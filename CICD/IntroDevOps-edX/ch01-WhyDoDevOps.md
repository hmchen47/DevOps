=========================

# Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

# Section 1: Understanding Improvement
## Understanding Improvement (Part I)
### Notes
+ Three ways of DevOps:
    + The first way - accelerating delivery
    + The second way - feedback loop
    + The third way - continuous learning
+ IT characteristics w/o conflict
    + faster
    + cheaper
    + safer
+ Categories of organizations:
    + Pathological - power oriented
    + Bureaucrative 
    + Generative - preformance oriented

## Understanding Improvement (Part IV)
### Notes
+ Continuous Deliveray Principles
    + build quality in
    + work in small batches
    + automate repeatable tasks
    + purse continuous improvement
    + everyone is responsible
+ Anti-Patterns:
    + incongruent testing and production environment
    + testing tasks too long
    + manual regression and acceptance tests
    + long lead times'+ high technical debt
    + slow and hard to change
+ Patterns: 
    + everyting starts in source control
    + peer review (pull requests)
    + automate everything
    + trunk based deployment
    + done means released
    + stop the line - in some cases, people swarm to do the fix
