Welcome and Introduction
========================

## Welcome to LFS161x
"Introduction to DevOps: Transforming and Improving Operations" aims to help you develop a good working knowledge of the concept of DevOps, covering the foundation, principles, and practices of DevOps. This course focuses on the successful patterns used by high-performance organizations over the past 10 years. 

The core structure of this course is organized around the three basic principles of DevOps, otherwise known as the "Three Ways". The "Three Ways" outline the values and philosophies that guide DevOps processes and practices:

The First Way - This is a set of principles and practices that accelerate the delivery of IT services. Much of the material covered in this section will focus on Continuous Delivery and the extended principles and practices that lead to an accelerated flow.
The Second Way - This is a set of principles and practices that amplify feedback loops. In this section we will cover the concepts of creating a problem-solving culture, as well as understand monitoring, as it applies to DevOps. A significant portion of this section will also include monitoring business metrics, and will also explain how change management applies to DevOps.
The Third Way - The patterns discussed in this section cover the concepts of organizational learning and safety culture. Items like blameless postmortems, resilience engineering, and systems thinking, as they apply to DevOps, will be covered in this course.
The goal of this course is to cover an extensive study of all of the DevOps principles and practices known to date, such that you can create transformative DevOps initiatives with incredible outcomes. This course also sets up the foundation for implementing the tools and technology that will be needed for further success and execution of a DevOps transformation.

If you are a manager or a practitioner looking for guidelines on how to start transforming organizations, this course is for you. Upon completion, you should have a good understanding of the foundation, principles, and practices of DevOps. You should be able to continue your progress for an organizational transformation using the acquired skills set.

## Before You Begin
If you are using edX for the first time, we strongly encourage you to start by taking a free 'how to use edX' course that the team at edX has made available. Click here to register and you will be on your way. You will find the edX platform very simple and intuitive. You can use the ribbon at the top of the screen to navigate the units within a Section or the Table of Content on the left to navigate between Chapters and Sections.

This course is self-paced, meaning there is no structured instructor availability. However, you will find the Discussion board (see the Discussion tab at the top of each page) to be very helpful, as a means of asking or answering questions and interacting with your peers taking the course. The Discussion board is moderated by The Linux Foundation.

For any technical issues with the edX platform (including login problems and issues with the Verified Certificate), please use the Support icon located on the top left of your screen.

## Syllabus and Grading
The full syllabus for this course can be downloaded here. Since this course is entirely self-paced, we include many demos and questions to help you practice the skills as you are acquiring them. The primary learning experience will come from you watching the videos and expanding your learning by accessing the external hyperlinks provided throughout the course. At the end of each chapter, you will have a set of graded knowledge check questions, that are meant to further check your understanding of the material presented. The grades obtained by answering these knowledge check questions will represent 20% of your final grade.

At the end of the course, you are required to pass a final exam, which consists of 30 questions. The remaining 80% of your final grade is represented by the score obtained in the final exam.

In order to complete this course with a passing grade, you must obtain a passing score (Knowledge Check and Final Exam) of minimum 70%.

You will have a maximum of 2 attempts to answer each question on the exam (other than true/false answers, in which case, you have only 1 attempt). It is an open book exam (meaning that you are free to reference your notes, screens from the course, etc.), and there is no time limit on how long you can spend on a question. You can always skip a question and come back to it later.

Getting your Certificate of Completion
Verified Certificates of completion are available once you achieve a passing score on the final exam. Once you have earned an overall grade of 70% or higher, you will be able to request your certificate directly from your Progress page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. 

## Course Timing
This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

## Course Progress & Completion
The goal of this course is to help you grasp the basics of DevOps. As a result, there are many opportunities to check your understanding using the Knowledge Check questions at the end of each chapter. Please keep in mind that the Knowledge Check questions are graded, and, as such, they do count towards your final passing grade (they represent 20% of your final grade). 

The Final Exam represents 80% of your passing grade. Once you complete the exam, you will want to know if you have passed. You will be able to see your completion status using the "Progress" tab at the top of your screen, which will clearly indicate whether or not you have achieved a passing score. Click here to view a sample of this screen in a new tab.

Certificates of completion (Verified Certificates) are available once you achieve a passing score of 70% on your course. Once you have done so, you can request the certificate on your "Progress" page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. The visuals below provide a guide to what this will look like.

## Guidelines to Discussions
One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Discussion boards. These boards can be used in the following ways:

To discuss concepts, tools, and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material.
To ask questions about course content.
To share resources and ideas related to cloud computing and technologies.
We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion boards will be reviewed periodically by The Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource. To learn more tips about using the Discussion boards, click here.

## Learning Aids
This course uses several types of learning aids to enhance your learning experience. 

Videos
This course is made up primarily of videos, in which the instructor explains the concepts and principles of DevOps, providing numerous case studies and making reference to additional resources that you can use. Unless you have a very limited bandwidth connection, we suggest you click on the HD button for a much improved viewing experience.

These questions, just like the demos, were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned.  It is important to point out that the knowledge check questions are graded and they count towards your passing grade. We would like to emphasize as well that you will be required to take a final exam to complete this course.
