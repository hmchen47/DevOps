Kubernetes Community
====================

## Introduction
Just as with any other open source project, the Community plays a vital role in Kubernetes. The Community decides the roadmap of the projects and works towards it. The Community gets engaged in different online and offline forums, like Meetups, Slack, Weekly meetings, etc. In this chapter, we will explore the Kubernetes Community and see how you can become a part of it, too. 

## Learning Objectives
+ Discuss about the Kubernetes community.
+ Learn about the different channels to interact with the Kubernetes community.
+ Discuss about CNCF events.

## Kubernetes Community
With more than [23 thousand GitHub stars](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/), Kubernetes is one of the most popular open source projects. The Community members not only help with the source code, but they also help with sharing the knowledge. The Community engages in both online and offline activities.

Currently, there is a project called [K8sPort](http://k8sport.org/), which recognizes and rewards Community members for their contributions to Kubernetes. This contribution can be in the form of code, attending and speaking at meetups, answering questions on Stack Overflow, etc.

Next, we will review some of the mediums used by the Kubernetes Community.

## Weekly Meetings and Meetup Groups
+ Weekly Meetings

    A weekly community meeting happens using video conference tools. You can get a calendar invite from [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-community-video-chat).

+ Meetup Groups

    There are many [meetup groups around the world](https://www.meetup.com/topics/kubernetes/), where local community members meet at regular intervals to discuss about Kubernetes and it's ecosystem.

There are some online meetup groups as well, where community members can meet virtually.

## Slack Channels and Mailing Lists
+ Slack Channels

    Community members are very active on the Kubernetes Slack. There are different channels based on topics, and anyone can join and participate in the discussions. You can discuss with the Kubernetes team on the `#kubernetes-users` channel. 

+ Mailing Lists

    There are Kubernetes [users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-users) and [developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-dev) mailing lists, which can be joined by anybody interested.

## SIGs and Stack Overflow
+ Special Interest Groups

    Special Interest Groups (SIGs) focus on specific parts of the Kubernetes project, like scheduling, authorization, Networking, Documentation, etc. Each group may have a different workflow, based on its specific requirements. A list with all the current SIGs can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).

    Depending on the need, a [new SIG can be created](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-governance.md#sig-creation-procedure).

+ Stack Overflow

    Besides Slack and mailing lists, Community members can get support from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes), as well. Stack Overflow is an online environment where you can post questions that you cannot find an answer for. The Kubernetes team also monitors the posts tagged Kubernetes.

## CNCF Events
CNCF organizes numerous [international conferences on Kubernetes, as well as other CNCF projects](https://www.cncf.io/events/). Two of the major conferences it organizes are:

+ CloudNativeCon + KubeCon Europe
+ CloudNativeCon + KubeCon North America.


## What's Next on Your Kubernetes Journey?

+ Participating in activities and discussions organized by the Kubernetes community
+ Attending events organized by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and The Linux Foundation
+ Expanding your Kubernetes knowledge and skills by enrolling in [LFS258 - Kubernetes Fundamentals](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/kubernetes-fundamentals), a paid course offered by The Linux Foundation 
+ Preparing for the upcoming Kubernetes Certified Administrator exam, which will be offered by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
+ And many other options.
