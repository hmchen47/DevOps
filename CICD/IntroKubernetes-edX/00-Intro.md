Welcome & Introduction
======================

## Welcome to LFS158x
Is your team beginning to use Kubernetes for container orchestration? Do you need guidelines on how to start transforming your organization with Kubernetes and cloud native patterns? Would you like to simplify software container orchestration and find a way to grow your use of Kubernetes without adding infrastructure complexity? Then this is the course for you!

In this course, we'll discuss some of Kubernetes' basic concepts and talk about the architecture of the system, the problems it solves, and the model that it uses to handle containerized deployments and scaling.

This course offers an introduction to Kubernetes and includes technical instructions on how to deploy a stand-alone and multi-tier application. Youâ€™ll learn about ConfigMaps and Secrets, and how to use Ingress.

Upon completion, developers will have a solid understanding of the origin, architecture and building blocks for Kubernetes and will be able to begin testing the new cloud native pattern to begin the cloud native journey.

## Course Learning Objectives
By taking this course, you will learn the following:

+ The origin, architecture, primary components, and building blocks of Kubernetes
+ How to set up and access a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube
+ Ways to run applications on the deployed Kubernetes environment, and access the deployed applications
+ The usefulness of Kubernetes communities, and how you can participate.

## Syllabus and Grading
The outline for this course can be downloaded [here](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/d41e7f113692772badd9322b59c82062/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+2T2017+type@asset+block/LFS158x_-_Introduction_to_Kubernetes.pdf). Since this course is entirely self-paced, we include demos and questions to help you practice the skills as you are acquiring them. At the end of each chapter, you will have a set of graded knowledge check questions, that are meant to further check your understanding of the material presented. The grades obtained by answering these knowledge check questions will represent 20% of your final grade.

At the end of the course, you are required to pass a final exam, which consists of 30 questions. The remaining 80% of your final grade is represented by the score obtained in the final exam.

__In order to complete this course with a passing grade, you must obtain a passing score (Knowledge Check and Final Exam) of minimum 70%.__

You will have a maximum of 2 attempts to answer each question on the exam (other than true/false answers, in which case, you have only 1 attempt). It is an open book exam (meaning that you are free to reference your notes, screens from the course, etc.), and there is no time limit on how long you can spend on a question. You can always skip a question and come back to it later.

## Getting your Certificate of Completion
If you are enrolled in a Verified track, Verified Certificates of completion are available once you achieve a passing score on the final exam. Once you have earned an overall grade of 70% or higher, you will be able to request your certificate directly from your Progress page. Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. There are no certificates available for Audit tracks.

## Course Timing
This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

## Guidelines to Discussions
One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Discussion boards. These boards can be used in the following ways:

+ To discuss concepts, tools, and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material.
+ To ask questions about course content.
+ To share resources and ideas related to cloud computing and technologies.

We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion boards will be reviewed periodically by The Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource.

## Learning Aids
This course uses several types of learning aids to enhance your learning experience. 

### Videos
This course has numerous videos, in which the instructor explains the concepts and principles of Kubernetes. You may want to click on the CC button to see closed captioning. Click [here](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS151.x+2T2016+type@asset+block@Welcome_Chapter_Video_screencapture.jpg) to see additional hints. 

### External Resources
You will also have numerous opportunities to expand your knowledge of Kubernetes by accessing the external hyperlinks we provide throughout the entire course.

### Check Your Understanding
At the end of each chapter, you will find a series of Knowledge Check questions. These questions, just like the demos, were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned. It is important to point out that the knowledge check questions are graded and they count towards your passing grade. We would like to emphasize as well that you will be required to take a final exam to complete this course.
