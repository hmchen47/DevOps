2. Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position. You have a computer that won't connect to the network. You've already asked the user all the necessary questions, and now you begin troubleshooting. What's the next best first step you can take?

        A. Restart the computer. It could be a weird Internet issue.
        B. Isolate the problem to either the computer or the network.
        C. Wipe and format the machine from scratch.

3. Situation: You work for a company that requires a visual verification when resetting passwords. The verification doesn't have to be done through your company account. However, you must see the person "live" (not through a picture), so that you can match them to their photo before resetting their account.

    Anastasia: Thanks for calling. My name is Anastasia. How can I help you?

    Ling: Hi, Anastasia. This is Ling. I need to reset my account password.

    How would you respond to the user?

        A. Stop what you're doing and explain to the user that passwords should have numbers and symbols for security purposes, and that this is more important than productivity.
        B. Ignore the user and keep working on resetting the password so that you don’t lose your place.
        C. Kindly ask the user to stop asking questions, since you're trying to solve their problem.

        You're acknowledging the user’s questions, but setting a clear agenda of what you want to accomplish. This allows them to understand what they should anticipate and helps you keep control of the conversation.

5. A user walks in to get IT support. The IT Support Specialist is a female. The user is male. There's also a male IT Support Specialist in the room. The user explains to the IT Support Specialist that his co-worker is on leave and he needs to access her files. The female technician attempts to explain the policy, which doesn't allow for this, given security issues. The male user demands to speak with the male IT Support Specialist to reach a solution.

    If you were the male technician in this situation, what would you do?

        B. After the user has left, see how the female tech is doing and give her tips on how to deal with similar situations in the future.
        C. Step in and answer the user's question.
        D. Tell the user that there is no difference in knowledge and understanding between you and your co-worker.

        Ans: D
        You are not going as far as confronting the user, which can be really difficult. Rather, you're reinforcing and supporting her work as a fellow IT Support Specialist. It's not always the person being undermined who is responsibility for "sticking up for herself."
