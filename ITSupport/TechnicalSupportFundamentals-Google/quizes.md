# Starting It Up
1. Question 1
What is the difference between a ROM chip and a RAM chip? Check all that apply.

        A. A ROM chip is non-volatile and will keep its data in the case of a power failure. A RAM chip is volatile and will wipe its data in the case of a power failure.
        B. A ROM chip is volatile and will wipe its data in the case of a power failure. A RAM chip is non-volatile and will keep its data in the case of a power failure.
        C. A ROM chip stores temporary data. A RAM chip stores permanent data.
        D. A ROM chip stores permanent data. A RAM chip stores temporary data.

        Ans: A, D
        Explaination:
        A ROM chip stores permanent data and will keep its data if there is a power failure. A RAM chip stores temporary data and will wipe its data in a power failure.

2. Which of these functions does the BIOS perform? Check all that apply.

        A. POST
        B. Checks what devices are connected to the computer
        C. Installs drivers
        D. Initializes hardware

        Ans: A, B, D
        The BIOS performs a POST to check what devices are connected to the computer. It also initializes hardware on boot.


3. Where are your BIOS settings stored?

        A. Hard drive
        B. Flash drive
        C. CMOS chip
        D. RAM

        Ans:C
        Your BIOS settings are stored in the CMOS chip.

4. What is the difference between a traditional BIOS and UEFI? Check all that apply.

        A. A traditional BIOS has better compatibility with newer hardware.
        B. UEFI has better compatiblity with newer hardware.
        C. UEFI is meant to become the new standard for BIOS.
        D. UEFI has become the default BIOS on new systems.

        Ans: B, C, D
        UEFI is the new standard for BIOS. It has become the default BIOS on new systems and it has better compatibility with newer hardware.

# Create a File with Windows
1. Qwiklabs-managed Google Cloud Console accounts are permanent, and can be accessed after a lab ends.

Ans: False
All Qwiklabs-managed Google Cloud Console accounts, and their associated resources, will be deleted once the lab ends.

2. Before you access a Windows virtual machine for the first time in Google Cloud Console, you must:

A. Click the SSH button next to the name of the virtual machine.
B. Set a Windows password.
C. Close the Server Manager application on the virtual machine.
D. Use the sudo command.

Ans: B
Before connecting to a Windows virtual machine, you need to set a Windows username and password; if this doesn’t happen, you’ll be unable to authenticate. Make sure to do this for each Qwiklabs that uses Windows

3. True or false: You can use the same Google Cloud Console username and password for every Qwiklabs exercise throughout the program.

Ans: False
Every Qwiklabs exercise will provide a unique username and password to access your Google Cloud console. These credentials expire once the lab is complete.

4. What’s the default name for a new folder in Windows?

A. Untitled folder
B. New folders don’t have names; they’re just blank
C. New folder
D. My Super Cool Folder

Ans: C
If you create a new folder in Windows, and don’t specify a name, it’ll default to New folder. A folder’s name can be changed at any point in the future.
5. In Google Cloud Console, virtual machines can be found under which of the following menu options:

A. Compute Engine -> VM instances
B. Container Engine -> Container clusters
C. App Engine -> Instances
D. Instances -> Virtual machines

Ans: A
In Google Cloud Console, virtual machines for labs are available in the Menu, by selecting the Compute Engine category, then VM instances.
