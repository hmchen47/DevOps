# Binary
1. Which of these is a valid byte? Check all that apply.

        a. 11011011
        b. 10022011
        c. 11100
        d. 00000000

        Ans: a, d
        A byte is composed of eight bits of zeros and ones.

2. How many possible values can we have with 8 bits?

        a. 8
        b. 127
        c. 256
        d. 1 byte

        Ans: c
        Bits use the binary system, which is also known as the base-2 numeral system. So 2^8 allows us 256 values from 0 to 255.

3. Why did UTF-8 replace the ASCII character-encoding standard?

        a. ASCII can store a character in more than one byte.
        b. ASCII can represent emoji.
        c. UTF-8 only uses 128 values.
        d. UTF-8 can store a character in more than one byte.

        Ans: d
        UTF-8 replaced the ASCII character-encoding standard because it can store a character in more than a single byte. This allowed us to represent a lot more character types, like emoji.

4. What is the highest decimal value we can represent with a byte?

        a. Any number
        b. 2
        c. 256
        d. 255

        Ans: d
        There are 256 values in a byte, from the decimal number 0 to 255.

5. The binary value of the ASCII letter "c" is 0110 0011. Using the handy chart that we learned in the lesson, convert this number to its decimal value. You'll need to use some math for this question.

        a. 123
        b. 99
        c. 45
        d. 100

        Ans: b
        The decimal value 99 is same as the binary value 0110 0011. So the numbers that are turned ON are 64, 32, 2, and 1 and added up together. In other words, 64 + 32 + 2 + 1 = 99.

        A. Tell the user that they’re crazy, and that bandwidth has nothing to do with their issue.

        B. Ask more questions about what programs they’re using.

        C. Suggest the the user reboot his machine when this happens.

        D. Ask if this happens for the rest of the day, or just a period of the day?

        Ans: D
        Nice work! While both B and D answer options are correct, this response shows that you were paying attention to the little clues that people leave. The user mentions that this always happens after lunch. Pinpointing the exact time of day and programs used will help you better diagnose the issue faster.


### Customer Ticket
From the user:

My machine is saying I have to reboot, but this is silly. I have a ton of processes running, I don’t want to have to reload everything. This is a waste of time. I’ve included a screenshot of the message. Please advise.

# Troubleshooting Best Practices
1. Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position and a user comes to you and says they can't access their online bank account. Choose the best response.

        A. Can you explain to me in detail what you mean by not being able to access your online bank account? What specific part doesn't work?
        B. Please restart your computer.
        C. It might be the Internet. Make sure you're connected to a network first.
        D. Let's try to test this by logging in on my computer.

        Ans:A
        Remember, when tasked with a problem, don't jump to conclusions. Ask questions first and gather more information. The issue be an incorrect login, a poor network connection, a server issue with the bank, or something else. Always ask questions first!

2. Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position. You have a computer that won't connect to the network. You've already asked the user all the necessary questions, and now you begin troubleshooting. What's the next best first step you can take?

        A. Restart the computer. It could be a weird Internet issue.
        B. Isolate the problem to either the computer or the network.
        C. Wipe and format the machine from scratch.
        D. Ask more questions.

        Ans: B
        Since you've already gathered information about the problem, it's time to start figuring out what the issue is. There are two things that could be wrong: either the computer is having issues or it's the network. You can rule one out by testing whether or not someone else is able to connect to the network.

3.Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position and a user comes to you and says they can't login to their computer. Choose the best response.

        A. Restart the computer. It could be a weird login issue.
        B. Ask the user, "when was the last time you were able to login? What has changed since then?"
        C. Check the network device they're connected to.
        D. Check if the user has their caps lock enabled.

        Ans: B
        Remember to ask questions in order to try to figure out what happened before the issue came up.

4. Scenario: You're working with a computer that doesn't run your newly installed software correctly. You've already asked the right questions, but you can't seem to isolate the problem to anything specific. Which of the following responses is the next best step to take?

        A. Restart the computer. It could be an issue of the software installation needing a reboot, restarting takes about 2 minutes.
        B. Reinstall the software again, which will take about 15 minutes.
        C. Wipe the computer and format it from scratch, which will take a few hours.
        D. Run diagnostic tools, which will take about an hour.

        Ans: A
        A reboot might be required for the software to be fully installed. In this case, a reboot is also the quickest troubleshooting step to take.

# Customer Service
1. Free response: What's the difference between good and great customer service? What's the most important part of customer service to you?

        Ans: Understanding the point of view from customer aspect than yourself.  Ans let them know what the issue is and how you solve it.

2. You're doing desktop support and the company policy is that you can only help with company equipment. A user walks in:

    Tech: Hi there, how can I help you?

    User: My computer is really slow and I can barely use it. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?

    Tech: It looks like this is a personal computer. Are you talking about your work computer?

    User: Uh, no, this is the one that I need help with. I figured you’re good with computers and you could help. My daughter needs it for a school assignment that’s due tomorrow, but it's too slow for her to get anything done.

    What would you do?

        A. Forget about that pesky policy and help him! His poor daughter needs to finish her assignment!
        B. Politely tell him that it's against the company policy, and you can’t help him.
        C. Tell him you can’t help him and suggest that he go to a local tech store for help.
        D. Explain why you can’t troubleshoot the issue, per the company policy. But give him some tips on what common issues could be slowing down his computer, and how he might go about fixing them.

        Ans: D
        This response sets expectations and then gives some helpful suggestions. Here, you're showing the user that you care about their issue, even if you can’t help them.

3. Situation: You work for a company that requires a visual verification when resetting passwords. The verification doesn't have to be done through your company account. However, you must see the person "live" (not through a picture), so that you can match them to their photo before resetting their account.

    Scenario: Phone call

    Anastasia: Thanks for calling. My name is Anastasia. How can I help you?

    Ling: Hi, Anastasia. This is Ling. I need to reset my account password.

    Anastasia: Hi, Ling. I’d be happy to help you with that, but first I need to verify your identity. Can you do a video call with me through Skype?

    Ling: I can’t get into my work account. That's why I’m calling. Question to ask:

    What would you do in this situation? Check all that apply.

        A. Ask the user if they have a personal account to use for Skype.
        B. Kindly tell them that they will have to wait until the next day to meet with someone live.
        C. Suggest that the user does a video call with you through their phone.
        D. Offer to set up a video call through Skype, Facetime, or Hangouts.

        Ans: A, C, D
        You're all about thinking outside the box to figure out what else the user can do to set up that call. You could potentially suggest that they go to an internet cafe or local library with wifi, too.

4. A user needs their password reset. The IT Support Specialist is pulling up the necessary information while the user starts asking a bunch of questions: Why does the password have to have a capital and a symbol? Why can’t I write it down? Why does it change so often? Isn’t this a waste of time?

    How would you respond to the user?

        A. Stop what you're doing and explain to the user that passwords should have numbers and symbols for security purposes, and that this is more important than productivity.
        B. Ignore the user and keep working on resetting the password so that you don’t lose your place.
        C. Kindly ask the user to stop asking questions, since you're trying to solve their problem.
        D. Let the user know that you're working on their issue and will be sure to answer all of their questions once you're done.

        Ans: D
        You're acknowledging the user’s questions, but setting a clear agenda of what you want to accomplish. This allows them to understand what they should anticipate and helps you keep control of the conversation.

5. A user walks in to get IT support. The IT Support Specialist is a female. The user is male. There's also a male IT Support Specialist in the room. The user explains to the IT Support Specialist that his co-worker is on leave and he needs to access her files. The female technician attempts to explain the policy, which doesn't allow for this, given security issues. The male user demands to speak with the male IT Support Specialist to reach a solution.

    If you were the male technician in this situation, what would you do?

        A. Ignore it.
        B. After the user has left, see how the female tech is doing and give her tips on how to deal with similar situations in the future.
        C. Step in and answer the user's question.
        D. Tell the user that there is no difference in knowledge and understanding between you and your co-worker.

        Ans: D
        You are not going as far as confronting the user, which can be really difficult. Rather, you're reinforcing and supporting her work as a fellow IT Support Specialist. It's not always the person being undermined who is responsibility for "sticking up for herself."
