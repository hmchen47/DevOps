# Practice Peer-graded Assignment: Assembling a Computer
## Instructions
Overview: Knowing how to assemble and disassemble a computer is an important part of an IT Support Specialist role. You may need to replace a faulty motherboard or RAM of a computer in your “machine fleet.” This assignment will help you learn and demonstrate how to build a desktop computer from scratch.

What You'll Do: This peer review assignment has two parts.

You will document each step of the assembly process with photographs while building your computer.
You will write a short reflective essay about what each computer component does and what you learned from the assembly process.
Grading: This is a required activity for the module*. The activity is peer reviewed, so after you submit your response, you need to review and evaluate one submission from other learners taking this course. To grade other submissions, follow the instructions and respond to the questions.

*Note: This assignment requires hardware components, which you may need to purchase or disassemble from other computers in order to complete the project. Therefore, if you do not have access to these components, we recommend you take the other graded assessment in this module in order to complete the course.

### Review criterialess

## Qwiklabs Overview
In this IT Support Professional Certificate, we will be using a tool called Qwiklabs to simulate many of the real-world experiences you may encounter in a tech role. In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the Qwiklabs platform and interact with a Windows virtual machine.

## Lab Introduction
This lab will introduce you to the Qwiklabs online learning platform, powered by the Google Cloud Console. You’ll interact with Qwiklabs in lots of courses of the IT Support Professional Certificate program, so it’s important that you follow these instructions carefully. We’ll give you some background information about what Qwiklabs are, how these labs will help train you as an IT Support Specialist, and how to setup your Google Cloud Console via Qwiklabs. Finally, you’ll interact with the lab materials themselves. Ready? Let’s get started!

## What you’ll do
There are two learning objectives for this lab:
+ Familiarize yourself with the Qwiklabs environment and log into the Google Cloud Console.
+ Access a Windows VM instance and create a basic file using the graphical user interface (GUI).

You will have 60 minutes to complete this lab.

## Create a File with Windows

### Introduction
This lab will introduce you to the Qwiklabs online learning platform, powered by the Google Cloud Console. You'll interact with Qwiklabs in lots of courses of the IT Support Professional Certificate program, so it's important that you follow these instructions carefully. We'll give you some background information about what Qwiklabs are, how these labs will help train you as an IT Support Specialist, and how to setup your Google Cloud Console via Qwiklabs. Finally, you'll interact with the lab materials themselves. Ready? Let's get started!

#### What are Qwiklabs and Google Cloud console?
Qwiklabs is an online learning environment that will take you through a live, real-world tech scenario that you may encounter as an IT Support Specialist. Qwiklabs works with the Google Cloud Console to "spin up," or create, virtual machines. A virtual machine (VM) is exactly how it sounds: it creates a "virtual" (rather than actual) simulation of software. As you've learned throughout the Technical Support Fundamentals course, the Windows operating system (OS) is just a piece of software. Qwiklabs works with the Google Cloud Console to simulate software and other tech scenarios for you. This way, you don't have to purchase this software to complete the courses in the IT Support Professional Certificate. This also allows you to use Windows OS as if it was installed on your local machine, so you can practice and familiarize yourself with this technology.

In this Qwiklab, you'll spin up a virtual machine of the Windows OS. In other Qwiklabs throughout the IT Support Professional Certificate, you may spin up other instances (or other occurrences) of software; Qwiklabs isn't just limited to operating systems. You'll soon learn that, with Qwiklabs and Google Cloud Console, you can interact with many other real-world scenarios that you may see as an IT Support Specialist.

Head's up: Each Qwiklab will create a temporary Google Console account that will last only for the duration of the lab. In other words, you'll need to repeat the login steps for each Qwiklab offered in the IT Support Professional Certificate program.

__Learning tip:__

Whenever possible, we encourage you to try these exercises on your local machines or home computers -- if that's an option for you! When you're learning something new for the first time, or you're trying to improve a skill that you already have, remember that "practice makes perfect." So, practice the skills you'll learn in the Qwiklabs as much as you can!

__What you'll do__

There are three learning objectives for this lab:
+ Familiarize yourself with the Qwiklabs environment and log into the Google Cloud Console.
+ Access a Windows VM instance and create a basic file using the graphical user interface (GUI).

You will have 60 minutes to complete this lab.

Qwiklabs will generate a temporary Google account and password for you to log into the Google Cloud Console. After you login using these temporary credentials, you can access the VM instances and continue with the lab's learning objectives.

__Step 1: Install Google Chrome__

Before you get started, we recommend that you install the Google Chrome browser on your machine. We recommend that you use Chrome for this Qwiklab because you'll need to install a Chrome App to access the Windows instance. We'll explain this in more detail later in the lab.

You can install Google Chrome here:
https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html

Once you've installed Google Chrome, we recommend that you re-open the Qwiklab in the Chrome browser.

__Step 2: Starting the lab__

Next, you'll need to start the lab before you can access the materials in the virtual machine OS. To do this, click the green "Start Lab" button at the top of the screen.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/48d20c63be13d7f7.png)

After you click the "Start Lab" button, the "Connect" tab will expand from the left-hand side of your screen. You should have a screen that looks like this:

__Step 3: Accessing the Google Cloud console__

__Finding the account credentials__

You'll use the information in the "Lab Connection" window to create a temporary username and password to log into the Google Cloud Console. You'll see that the Lab Connection window includes "Google Console Details," with three subfields: GCP Project ID, Username, and Password. You'll need to copy and paste the username and password into the Google Console, which you'll open up in the next step.

Head's up: The username and password provided to you will be deleted when the lab is over. So, you'll need to repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each Qwiklab offered in the IT Support Professional Certificate program.

__Logging in to the Google Cloud console__

Click the green "Open Google Console" button at the bottom of Lab Connect. This will open a new tab or window in your Web browser. If you already have a [Google Cloud account](https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2F%3Frefresh%3D1&service=cloudconsole), log out of it now. Alternatively, open a new "Incognito" window and navigate to the Google Cloud Console manually. This will prevent Chrome from remembering your temporary account.

Now, you need to sign in to the Google Cloud Console using your new account. This is where you'll paste the username of the account from the previous step. After you paste the account username, click "Next."

After you add the account, paste the password from the previous step.

Next, you'll see a Google Terms of Service agreement.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/4811cd4fb2e18227.png)

Click "Accept" to move forward with the lab. After you accept, you'll login to the Google Cloud Platform interface.

Note: If you see a screen that says, "You don't have permissions to perform the action on the selected resource," make sure that you're signed into the Google Cloud Platform with the account generated via Lab Connect -- not your personal or professional Gmail account. To switch accounts, click the profile picture in the top right of the screen and "switch accounts" to the username you selected in the previous step.

+ __Step 4: Accessing the virtual machine__

Now that you're logged into the Google Cloud Console via Qwiklabs, you need to access the lab's virtual machine (VM) instance. The next steps will help you navigate to the virtual machine resources.

__Selecting the right resource__

When you first log in to the console you should see a screen that asks you to choose a resource to work with, like this:

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/81aeee2597b82404.png)

Click on the second "Project name," which should start with "qwiklabs-gcp-" followed by some random characters (highlighted in blue below):

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/4d354e89220d5938.png)

Next, you'll see a pop-up "Updates to Terms of Service" window. Select "Yes" and click "Accept" to move on to the next part of the lab.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/13047ef9f99b7b49.png)

__Finding the virtual machine__

After you accept the Terms of Service, you might see a page that looks like this:

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/7abc99753814138c.png)

Or you might see a page that looks like this:

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/b8946295447ceb08.png)

Whatever page you see load on your screen, you actually don't need to do anything here.

Next, click the three horizontal bars at the top left of the page (shown below in red) to open the menu dropdown. Hover over "Compute Engine" to select "VM Instances."

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/60a2eeff4c279e19.png)

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/4fcd3e31733d685a.png)

You should then see a screen that lists all the VM instances you have access to. You should see one Windows VM instance there.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/15fd58b0268c7fbf.png)

You're almost ready to connect to the instance, but there's one more step that you need to do, since this lab uses a Windows graphical user interface (GUI).

__Using RDP to connect - for Windows labs only__

For the Windows portion of the lab, you'll use the Windows GUI to create a file. Because we want to interact with Windows GUI, you'll need to install the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) plugin in your Web browser to remotely access this Windows VM instance. This method requires you to be logged into the Google Cloud Console from Google Chrome.

You'll only do the following step once, which requires you to download an app for your web browser. We strongly recommend that you use the Chrome web browser to complete this lab (and all the other Qwiklabs). This is because the Chrome RDP app is best designed for the Chrome Web browser. You may not need to use RDP for all Qwiklabs in the IT Support Professional Certificate, but you will need to do that for this lab. In the steps below, we'll walk you through how to use RDP to connect with the Windows GUI virtual machine.

__Connecting with Google Chrome and Chrome RDP (preferred, all platforms)__

If you still needto install the Chrome Web browseron yourcomputer,download the browser from here: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html

Once you have Chrome installed on your computer, download the "Chrome RDP" app from the Chrome app store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-rdp-for-google-clo/mpbbnannobiobpnfblimoapbephgifkm

This app will allow you to control the virtual machine from your browser without any other installations.

__Connecting from other platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows)__

If you're unable to use Google Chrome and Chrome RDP App to connect, you can use the guides below to connect to your Windows instance. We've provided brief instructions for each platform, but please note that not all steps may be the same for your specific platform.

- [Connecting from a Windows computer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSVAWbyeYZssGdHD5a8q2_ccOMd1e9WJe0U-fVZo0eo/edit)
- [Connecting from a Mac computer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZwwLr3eZuEwKqleSSKLTNI5rRHIc4IK4ZNZRttsmVg/edit#heading=h.7sa4zxkhmsum)
- [Connecting from a Linux computer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MLJ8yi6nPz8YHgnuUUY9j1ZbzSkkaTCqmO2zNRxkzOE/edit)

__Starting RDP for Windows VM__

Now that you have RDP installed on your browser, return to the screen that shows your Windows VM instance. Under the "Connect" field, there should be a drop-down to the right of the VM instance name. Click the arrow and select "Set Windows password."

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/3599bf369ed056ca.png)

A popup will appear asking for your username. (Make sure pop-ups are enabled in your browser.) Set any username you want and click "Set." It'll take a short while to process, and a new screen will appear.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/23d18d7220111596.png)

After this process is finished, a new pop-up will appear with a password for your account on the Windows virtual machine. Save this password by copying it to your clipboard, since you'll be unable to recover it once the window is closed. (You can save the password by clicking the "Copy" icon to the very right of the password.) Once you have it saved somewhere, close the popup.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/89f3f6399d80d77e.png)

Now you're finally ready to connect to the Windows OS! In the "VM Instances" screen, click the "RDP" button. The RDP app should open in a new browser window. You'll then see a screen, as shown below: 

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/f2bcad014a74dc23.png)

Log in using the password that you just copied from the last step. Leave the "Domain" field blank.

If you see an error message (like the one shown below), close RDP and wait a minute or so. Sometimes the VM-creation process takes a few minutes, and you won't be able to access the VM until it's finished.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/79f642fff031dccc.png)

You should now see a visual interface that looks exactly like the Windows 10 OS!

If you weren't able to connect for any reason, or if you need to reset your password, click the RDP button and repeat the previous steps.

__Using the Windows instance__

Now the you have access to the Windows instance, you're ready to start using it! This version of Windows is intended to be used on a Server, and auto-starts a server-management program. We don't need this for this lab, so wait for it to finish starting and then close it. You may see the desktop appear for a few seconds before the program launches.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/3c1325d360b6b50d.png)

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/1b105266ddc1fd42.png)

Once that's closed, the Windows OS is ready for you to use.

__Finishing the login process__

Now you ‘ll see a Windows desktop background that looks like this:

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/3a0776168efd480a.png)

__Creating a folder__

Creating a folder in Windows is super simple. Right-click anywhere on the desktop and you should see this menu appear:

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/893440b27ea1a524.png)

Hover your cursor over "New," and another menu should appear that looks like this:

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/70a7615a3ee13ba5.png)

Move your cursor to the first option ("Folder"), and select it. If your cursor leaves the menus, they may disappear; if this happens, just repeat the steps again. A new folder should appear on the desktop. It'll be called "New folder" by default, and the text should already be highlighted for you to edit.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/2ac63b2a6d11354e.png)

If you click anywhere before changing the name, you'll need to right-click the folder and select the "Rename" option to be able to edit it. Change the name to "My Super Cool Folder".

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/a35df2f7ca600795.png)

Your folder has been created and named! To verify, double-click on the folder and a Windows Explorer window should pop up, showing you the contents of your currently empty folder.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35302/original/img/182f872fa223868a.png)

### Congratulations!

That's it! You've successfully navigated the Google Cloud Console, accessed a Windows virtual machine using an RDP connection, and created a folder in the instance. There will be much more interesting labs to come, but the steps of connecting to Windows instances will remain the same. So. feel free to use this lab as a refresher if you ever forget the process.

You can now close the browser window that you have open to the Google Cloud Console or this lab, and any RDP/SSH window. You can manually end the lab, or it will automatically end when the time runs out.



# Create a File with Linux
Introduction
This lab will introduce you to the Qwiklabs online learning platform, powered by the Google Cloud Console. You will interact with Qwiklabs in many courses of the IT Support Professional Certificate program, so it's important you follow these instructions carefully. In these instructions, we will give you some background information about what Qwiklabs are, how these labs will help train you as an IT Support Specialist, how to setup your Google Cloud Console via Qwiklabs, and then finally, you'll interact with the lab materials themselves.

__What are Qwiklabs and Google Cloud console?__

Qwiklabs is an online learning environment that will walk you through a live, real-world tech scenario that you will see as an IT Support Specialist. Qwiklabs works with the Google Cloud Console to "spin up" or create virtual machines. A virtual machine (VM) is exactly how it sounds: it creates a "virtual" (rather than actual) simulation of software. As you've learned throughout the Technical Support Fundamentals course, Windows and Linux operating systems (OS) are just pieces of software. Qwiklabs works with the Google Cloud Console to simulate software and other tech scenarios for you, so that you don't have to purchase this software to complete the courses in the IT Support Professional Certificate. This also allows you to use Windows and Linux OS as if it were installed on your local machine, giving you the opportunity to practice and familiarize yourself with this technology.

In this Qwiklab, you will spin up a virtual machine of the Windows and Linux OS. In other Qwiklabs throughout the IT Support Professional Certificate, you may spin up other instances (or other occurrences) of software, so Qwiklabs isn't just limited to operating systems. You'll soon learn that, with Qwiklabs and Google Cloud Console, you can interact with many other real-world scenarios that you'll see as an IT Support Specialist.

Note: Each Qwiklab will create a temporary Google Console account that will last only for the duration of the lab. In other words, you will need to repeat the login steps for each Qwiklab offered in the IT Support Professional Certificate program.

__Learning tip:__

Whenever possible, we encourage you to try these exercises on your local machines or home computers -- if that's an option for you! When you're learning something new for the first time, or you're trying to improve a skill that you already have, remember that "practice makes perfect." So practice the skills you'll learn in the Qwiklabs as much as you can!

__What you'll do__

There are two learning objectives for this lab:

1. You will familiarize yourself with the Qwiklabs environment and log into the Google Cloud Console
2. You will access a Linux VM instance and create a basic file using the command line interface

Qwiklabs will generate a temporary Google account and password for you to log into the Google Cloud Console. After you login using these temporary credentials, you can access the VM instances and continue with the lab's learning objectives.

__Step 1: Install Google Chrome__

Before you get started, we recommend that you install the Google Chrome browser on your machine. We recommend that you use Chrome for this Qwiklab because you will need to install a Chrome App to access the Windows instance. We'll explain this in more detail later in the lab.

You can install Google Chrome here:

https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html

Once you've installed Google Chrome, we recommend that you re-open the Qwiklab in the Chrome browser.

__Step 2: Starting the lab__

Next, you will need to start the lab before you can access the materials in the virtual machine OS. To do this, click the green "Start Lab" button at the top of the screen.

[image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35301/original/img/717dc697d23e9f95.png)

After you click the "Start Lab" button, the "Connect" tab will expand from the left-hand side of your screen. You should have a screen that looks like this:

__Step 3: Accessing the Google Cloud console__

__Finding the account credentials__

You will use the information in the "Lab Connection" window to create a temporary username and password to log into the Google Cloud Console. You will see the Lab Connection window includes "Google Console Details," with three subfields: GCP Project ID, Username, and Password. You will need to copy and paste the Username and Password into the Google Console, which you will open up in the next step.

Note: The username and password provided to you will be deleted when the lab is over, so you will need to repeat Steps 2 and Steps 3 for each Qwiklab offered in the IT Support Professional Certificate program.

__Logging in to the Google Cloud console__

Click the green "Open Google Console" button at the bottom of Lab Connect. This will open a new tab or window in your Web browser. If you already have a Google Cloud account, log out of it now. Alternatively, open a new "Incognito" window and navigate to the Google Cloud Console manually. This will prevent Chrome from remembering your temporary account.

Now you need to sign in to the Google Cloud Console using your new account. This is where you will paste the Username of the account from the previous step. After you paste the account username, click "Next."

After you add the account, paste the Password from the previous step.

Next, you will see a Google Terms of Service agreement.

![image](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/35301/original/img/4811cd4fb2e18227.png)

Click "Accept" to move forward with the lab. After you accept, you will login to the Google Cloud Platform interface.

Note: If you see a screen that says "You don't have permissions to perform the action on the selected resource," make sure that you are signed into the Google Cloud Platform with the account generated via Lab Connect, not your personal or professional Gmail account. To switch accounts, click the profile picture in the top-right of the screen and "switch accounts" to the Username you selected in the previous step.

__Step 4: Accessing the virtual machine__

Now that you're logged into the Google Cloud Console via Qwiklabs, you need to access the lab's virtual machine (VM) instance. The next steps will help you navigate to the virtual machine resources.

__Selecting the right resource__

You should then see a screen that lists all the VM instances you have access to; you should see one Linux VM instance.

### Using the Linux instance

__Accessing your Linux instance__

Make sure you are still logged into the Google Cloud Console using the username and password provided with the lab. As a reminder, your machines are available in Google Cloud Console under Compute Engine -> VM instances. If you are having difficulty connecting to your instance, follow the instructions at the beginning of this document to learn how to connect.

Navigate back to the "VM Instances" page, which shows the instance you have available to you for the lab. Find the "Connect" field, and click "SSH" to open the Linux instance. You can also click the dropdown arrow next to "SSH" and select "Open in browser window."

This will open a pop-up window (make sure pop-ups are enabled in your browser) that contains a terminal that will allow you to interact with your Linux instance. An example terminal is shown below. You will use this terminal for the rest of the lab when working with the Linux machine.

You are now ready to continue with the lab!

__Creating a Folder__

To create a sample folder, enter the following command into the terminal:

> `mkdir my-super-cool-folder`

This creates a directory called "my-super-cool-folder" in your current directory.

__Congratulations!__

That's it! You've successfully navigated the Google Cloud Console and accessed the Linux virtual machine using a SSH connection, and created a folder in the instance. There will be much more interesting labs to come, but the steps of connecting to Linux VM instances will remain the same, so feel free to use this lab as a refresher if you ever forget the process.

You can now close the browser window that you have open to the Google Cloud Console or this lab, and any RDP/SSH window. You can manually end the lab, or it will automatically end when the time runs out.
