## [Instructions for Accessing Qwiklabs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals/supplement/NlrJ3/instructions-for-accessing-qwiklabs)

### Connect to Windows virtual machines by Chrome RDP App (recommended)
Before you get started, we recommend that you install the Google Chrome browser on your computer. This is because you’ll need to remotely connect to a virtual machine, and using Google Chrome with a third-party Chrome App is the fastest way to do this! Follow the instructions in the PDF below to set this up.

### Connecting to Windows virtual machines from other platforms
If you're unable to use Google Chrome and the Chrome RDP App to connect, you can use the guides below to connect to your Windows instance from a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. We’ve provided brief instructions for each platform. Head’s up, though: Not all steps may be the same for your specific platform.
