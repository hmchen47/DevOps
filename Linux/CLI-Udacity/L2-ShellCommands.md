# Researching Commands
Really, don't run this command, `rm -rf /`. This isn't a joke. Look it up on a search engine and using the manual, and think about what it does.

Another useful tool for researching commands is the `apropos` command. You can use `apropos` to find commands relevant to particular keywords.

For example __apropos working directory__ provides a list of commands that somehow work with the current working directory.

`apropos` is good for refreshing your memory, or for finding new commands to explore!

# command: `less`
+ a program similar to `more`, but it has many more features.
+ Commands are based on both more and vi

# editor: `nano`
+ When giving a filename on the command line, the cursor can be put  on  a  specific  line  by adding the line number with a plus sign (+) before the filename, and even in a specific column by adding it with a comma.
