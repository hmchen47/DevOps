Section 1: Linux History
------------------------
# Introduction
Linux is a free open source computer operating system, initially developed for Intel __x86-based__ personal computers. It has been subsequently ported to many other hardware platforms.

In this section, you will become familiar with how Linux evolved from a student project into a massive effort with an enormous impact on today's world.

# Linux History
Linus Torvalds was a student in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991, when he started a project: writing his own operating system __kernel__. He also collected together and/or developed the other essential ingredients required to construct an entire __operating system__ with his kernel at the center. Soon, this became known as the __Linux__ kernel. 

In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the __General Public License (GPL)__ by __GNU__ (a project of the Free Software Foundation or FSF, which promotes freely available software), which made it possible to build a worldwide community of developers. By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous other developers created complete systems called Linux Distributions in the mid-90â€™s.
