# Before Your Begin
The goal of this course is to help you become familiar with the Linux operating system. It is designed to take you well beyond being a casual, personal user of Linux. You will start with the fundamentals and progress to explore the various tools and techniques commonly used by Linux users, programmers, and system administrators to do their day-to-day work.

You will also quickly notice some formatting conventions. We use bold text to indicate program or software names and monospace formatting for entries that go on the command line.

If you are using edX for the first time, we strongly encourage you to start by taking a free 'how to use edX' course that the team at edX has made available.
