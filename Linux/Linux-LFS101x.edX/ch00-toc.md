# Before Your Begin
The goal of this course is to help you become familiar with the __Linux__ operating system. It is designed to take you well beyond being a casual, personal user of __Linux__. You will start with the fundamentals and progress to explore the various tools and techniques commonly used by Linux users, programmers, and system administrators to do their day-to-day work.

You will also quickly notice some formatting conventions. We use bold text to indicate __program__ or __software names__ and monospace formatting for `entries that go on the command line`.

If you are using __edX__ for the first time, we strongly encourage you to start by taking a free 'how to use edX' course that the team at edX has made available. [Click here](https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038) to register and you will be on your way. You will find the edX platform very simple and intuitive. You can use the ribbon at the top of the screen to navigate from one page to the next, as well as the left menu to quickly navigate between Chapters and Sections.

# Syllabus and Grading
The full syllabus for this course can be downloaded here. Since this course is entirely self-paced, we include many questions, activities, and labs to help you practice the skills as you are acquiring them.

__In order to complete this course with a passing grade, you must obtain a passing score on the Final Exam of minimum 70%.__

You will have a maximum of 2 attempts to answer each question on the exam. It is an open book exam (meaning that you are free to reference your notes, screens from the course, etc.), and there is no time limit on how long you can spend on a question or on the entire exam. You can always skip a question and come back to it later.

# Course Progress, Completion & Certificates
The goal of this course is to help users develop their skills on __Linux__. As a result, there are many opportunities to practice what you have learned using Knowledge Check questions, 'Try It Yourself' simulations, and Labs (with solutions included), which are not graded, and do not count toward the final passing grade (only the final exam does that). One side effect of this is that your __course progress page will remain blank until you take the final exam__.  Don't worry about it, that's just how the platform is designed.

Once you completed the exam, you will want to know if you have passed!  You will be able to see your completion status using the "Progress" tab at the top of your screen, which will clearly indicate whether or not you have achieved a passing score. Click [here](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/844688bab4e76ef51c480af492ee4241/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+1T2017+type@asset+block/Student_progress.png) to view a sample of this screen in a new tab.

Certificates of completion (Verified Certificates) are available once you achieve a passing score. Once you have done so, you can request the certificate on your "Progress" page.  Once the request is completed (which may take up to 48 hours), you can then return to the same place and download your certificate. The visuals below provide a guide to what this will look like.

__Hint__: If you need to demonstrate proof of completion before your certificate is generated, we recommend that you take a screenshot of the course progress page.

# Course Timeline
This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. There is no specified period of time in which you have to finish. Having said that, the key to getting the most out of this (or any) course is to have a routine. As per your schedule, you could spend maybe one hour a day or perhaps a couple hours every weekend. Whatever it is, try to stick with it. That way you will find that you better recall what has previously been covered and are better able to digest the new material.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another, starting with some basic elements and progressing to more advanced topics. It is probably best to work through them in sequence in order to minimize confusion. If you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

# Learning Aids
Besides simple exposition through text and figures, this course uses several additional methods to present the learning material.

## Videos
There are many demonstration videos to help you understand procedures, as well as an introductory video for each chapter. The exact steps and procedures may vary somewhat, according to your specific Linux distribution. In addition, there is often more than one way to do something, so do not interpret the videos as something to be rigorously followed. You may want to click on the CC button to see closed captioning, or raise the playback speed to have it take less time. Click here to see additional hints.

## Try it Yourself
In these activities, you are asked to perform certain tasks, and your input is checked to see if it is correct, with specific feedback provided if it is not. These are not meant to replace the Lab exercises, but simply to provide some interim opportunities to practice. In order to keep the underlying multimedia files from becoming overly large and complex, we used a very linear algorithm, which recognizes only the specific answer covered in the material. Do not be discouraged if you type something that you think should work, but are shown feedback on a different suggested answer. It does not necessarily mean that what you entered would not work in the real world. In fact, we encourage you to experiment with the exercises on your live Linux system once you have done an initial pass through the simulation; this will give you the freedom to experiment with other variations and see what works. Also, please note that more advanced Linux users will sometimes know other (often more complicated) ways to do things that simply cannot be incorporated in these simulations. Such seasoned veterans are, of course, not the target audience for this course.

## Knowledge Check
In these sections, you are asked to answer short (usually multiple choice) questions to see if you have grasped the previous discussion. Otherwise, you may get somewhat lost as you proceed further. Once again, there may be a case where you give a slightly different, but correct answer and you are incorrectly told you are wrong, although we have tried to minimize fill-in-the-blank questions for exactly this reason. Remember you are not being graded!

# Lab Exercises
In all __The Linux Foundation__ courses (in any format) we put a heavy emphasis on learning by doing. In live, instructor-led classes we almost always aim for a 50/50 balance between lecture and discussion, and working on laboratory exercises, or homeworks, that either perform the tasks just described in the class, or try more ambitious variations. Instructors help students figure out how to do things, debug their code and scripts, etc. during these lab sessions.

Because this course is self-paced, without a live instructor, it will be up to you to control your time budget and make sure you take enough time to do the labs.

For most labs, there is an associated solution file you can view. Keep in mind that in many cases solutions are not unique, so just consider these answers as one representative method to solve the problem; you may actually have a better one!

# Guidelines to Discussions and Getting Help
One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Discussion boards. These boards can be used in the following ways:
    + To discuss concepts, tools, and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material.
    + To ask questions about course content.
    + To share resources and ideas related to Linux.

We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion boards will be reviewed periodically by __The Linux Foundation__ staff, but they are primarily a community resource. To learn more tips about using the Discussion boards, click [here](http://blog.edx.org/getting-most-out-edx-discussion-forums).

If you ever need technical assistance, help is at your fingertips using the Support button on the upper left side of your screen (in fact, go ahead and click on it now to see what it does!). Here you get technical help, ask general questions, or be directed to the Discussion Forum for content questions. 

# Three Important Pieces of Context
1. Things change in Linux
    No matter how hard we have worked to stay current, Linux is constantly evolving, both at the technical level (including kernel features) and at the distribution and interface level. So please keep in mind we have tried to be as up-to-date as possible at the time this course was released, but there may be changes and new features we have not discussed. This is unavoidable.

2. We have repeated some things in the class material
    It is just about impossible in a course this comprehensive to never revisit topics that have previously been covered, and short reviews are helpful so you do not have to go scouring through earlier sections to jog your memory. This is particularly true with system configuration items, like how to use sudo to gain temporary root privileges in as safe a manner as possible. We know we have done this and, at least in most cases, it is by design, not by accident.

3. We have tried to avoid holy wars
    There are many areas where there are strong preference disagreements in the Linux (and wider open-source) community. Examples include the best editor: __emacs__ vs. __vi__; the best graphical desktop: __GNOME__ vs. __KDE__, etc. Usually, we have chosen (when necessary) a particular alternative to emphasize just to keep things clean; for example, we talk much more about __GNOME__ than __KDE__ simply because it has a bigger user base, not because we are taking a position as to which is superior.

# A Note From the Author
This course is descended from the original Linux Foundation's Introduction to Linux course, which was always taught with a live instructor, either in a physical classroom, or in a virtual classroom over the Internet, for which we charged tuition. Converting this course to one that was free of charge and available to a large community was a task that The Linux Foundation believed was worthwhile and would be well-appreciated. When we began the process of converting to a self-paced course in the MOOC format for edX, we really had no idea of how much work it would be and how many changes we would have to make in the presentation, so it could both stand on its own without a live instructor and be entertaining enough to hold students' interest.

While I am listed as the author and instructor for this course, the truth is it could never have been produced without the effort of many individuals who have contributed their time and talent to its development. First and foremost, I have to thank Flavia Cioanca and Clyde Seepersad at The Linux Foundation, who have been deeply involved through relentless cycles of developing content and clarifying presentation. 

Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues at The Linux Foundation, for making this a team effort and investing the resources to make this come to fruition, helping to cover some of my other responsibilities while we were so occupied with this effort, and also for reviewing material as it was being prepared. I hope you enjoy seeing some of their faces and names in the video introductions that begin each chapter of the course.

# Final Thoughts Before You Begin
In order for you to get the most out of this course, we recommend that you have Linux installed on a machine that you can use throughout this course. You do not need to view the course material on a Linux machine (all you need is a browser). However, you will see that there is a lot of follow-along activities and labs that you will benefit from only if you can do them on your own machine. We have prepared a brief installation guide that helps you to select a Linux distribution to install, decide on whether you want to do a stand-alone pure Linux machine or a dual-boot one, whether do a physical or virtual install, etc. And then guides through the steps. You can download it [here](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/3fa6f8f7a7482a6344efeb7dd0d5bdf0/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+1T2017+type@asset+block/Preparing_Your_Computer_for_LFS101x.pdf). We will also discuss the installation procedure in detail in a later section.

We have not covered everything in great detail, but keep in mind that most of the documentation in Linux is actually already on your system in the form of __man__ pages, which we will discuss in great detail later. Whenever you do not understand something or want to know more about a command, program, topic, or utility, you can just type `man <topic>` at the command line. We will assume you are thinking this way and not constantly repeat "For more information, look at the `man` page for `<topic>`".

On a related note, throughout the course we use a shorthand that is common in the open source community. When referring to cases where the user has to make a choice of what to enter (e.g. name of a program or file), we use the short hand `'foo'` to represent `<insert file name here>`. So beware, we are not actually suggesting that you manipulate files or install services called 'foo'!
