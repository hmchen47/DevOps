Version Control with Git Final Project
======================================

# Instruction
Create a Git repository with the commits shown in the commit graph and table shown in the course's [final reading](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/_c21212a7257430a304207ee8a18029bb_Version-Control-with-Git-Final-Project.pdf?Expires=1514937600&Signature=PhbraYBpRJhIWf00Io5pTtE8AZtGelOnwqBIRY4ZrAtHfu254HrMfNqGrYoeq-LthU4t09kUSzkr~b1Rjr65nwnopQGH~b4ySDM0l7PfrUnPDIWWLklhriuHfAU8h2r4-RQ-~XJcNzBqVS-ugnU1f9B74ZgdOcP~vv4RNFq4NTk_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A). This simulates a team building and releasing a product using the Gitflow workflow. The first release (v1.00) has only one feature. Soon after release, a bug was discovered and a hotfix (v1.01) was necessary.

When you are finished, attach a .zip file of your Git repository.
