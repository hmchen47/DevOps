# 01. Explain Common Threats Against On-premises and Cloud Environments

Trainer: Knox Hutchinson


## Introducing the Cybersecurity Landscape

- Scope
  - learning key terms
  - understand the lanscape of cybersecurity


## Know Your Assets

- Assets
  - people: staffs including cybersecurity professionals
  - data: top security info
  - physical system


- Issues of assets
  - categories of assets: what types of assets, physical/software
  - responsibility:
    - who owns, maintain and use the assets
    - various names: owner, custodian, operators, administrator, end user, reader
  - sensitivity level


## Know Your Vulnerabilities

- Vulnerability sources
  - policy: people training
  - software: patch, e.g., operating systems
  - code design, protocol
  - network access
  - malware


## Know Your Threats

- Categories of threats
  - internal: people within an institute
  - external: black hat, white hat, gray hat, suicide hacker, script kiddie, cyber terrorist, state sponsored hacker, hacktivist


- Mitigation of threats
  - policies: stop people doing wrong thing, e.g., training
  - technical: NGFW, IDS/IPS, Web Content, email security, antivirus
  - physical: locks, keycard scanners, camera systems


## Virus, Worms, Trojan, and Malware

- Termonologies
  - virus
    - application, e.g., keylogger
    - replicate itself
  - worms
    - similar to virus
    - no end user to trigger but working on its own
  - trojans:
    - presenting itself as one application user needed
    - example: antivirus software


## Phishing and Social Engineering

- Vulnerability of people
  - phisinging: links in emails redirect to malicious websites
  - social engineering
    - research target company: dumpsters, websites, employees, tour company, etc.
    - choose victim: identify frustrated employees of target company
    - build relationship: develop relationship w/ target employee
    - exploit relationship: collect sensitive info and current technologies


## DDoS - Attacking Availability

- Denial od service (DoS) attacks
  - darknet:
    - internet where non-indexed w/ searching engine
    - requireing specific software to access
  - hacker as a service: taking down target website
  - ways to attack: social engineering, virus, etc.
  - typical attacks: TCP SYN requests, HTTP requests, Ping of death $\to$ buffer overflow


- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
  - botnet/zombie: infected computers around the world
  - flood the targets from these computers


## Spoofing and MitM Attacks

- MitM attacks
  - exfiltrate info


- spoofing attacks
  - known attacks: DNS, DHCP, MAC
  - redirect traffic by pretending as a real network service
  - mitigation: DAI, DHCP snooping


- CIA triad
  - confidentiality
  - integrity
  - availability


## Summarizing the Threat Landscape

- Summay
  - learn different threats
  - understand threats
  - mitigation and solutions following
