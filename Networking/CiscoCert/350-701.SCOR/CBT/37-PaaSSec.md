Trainer: Bart Castle


## Securing Cloud Platform-as-a-Service

- PaaS security
  - container
  - orchestrating containers
  - OWASP
  - micros-segmentation
  - Tetration
  - AppDynamic



## Plan for Containers

- Container overview
  - efficiency, sharing resources, and abstraction
  - software parts of virtual machines: OS and Apps
  - hardware parts of virtual machines: computing resources, including CPU, memory, storage, and network
  - focused on software parts, in particular, Apps
  - abstraction layer providing shared libraries
  - only focusing on Apps
  - components in container environment
    - container (image), e.g., docker
    - registry: a safe structured place to store images
    - orchestration
  - cloud service provider offering all 3 components
