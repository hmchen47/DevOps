# 14. DNA Center Foundations

Trainer: Knox Hutchinson


## Introducing DNA Center

- Learning goals
  - DNA center
  - Workflows
  - DNA center API


## What DNA Center Does

- DNA center overview
  - a new SDN solution
  - targeting at large enterprise
  - goal: simplify how to deploy, operate, and optimize a network infrastructure


- DNA software architecture
  - intent-based networking
  - example: group A members not allowed to communicated w/ group B members
  - intent-base infrastructure:
    - wireless access, switch, router, extended nodes
    - these devices capable of deploying business intent
    - running on IOS-XE, in general, Catalyst 9K devices
  - systems
    - DNA center appliance, standalone appliance
    - interacting w/ users
    - redundancy: 3x minimum
    - working closely w/ ISE, an AD like + network devices info
    - able to integrate w/ IPAM solution, IP addressing and services of network devices
  - platforms: APIs
    - assurance: enabling every point on the network to become a sensor, sending continuous streaming telemetry on application performance and user connectivity in real time
    - ML/AI feature to identify suspicious or abnormal issues
    - historical view and search for issues
