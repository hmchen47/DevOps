# 43. Explain Various Types of Endpoint Defenses

Trainer: Knox Hutchinson


## Introducing Endpoint Defense Mechanisms

- Learning goals
  - Anti-Virus & Anti-Malware
  - Indicators of compromise
  - Retrospective analysis
  - dynamic file anallysis


## Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware

- Anti-virus & Anti-Malware overview
  - used to be different but getting merged
  - EPP
    - point-in-time
    - comapring hash value: patterns
    - scanning signature: creator, date, etc.
    - performing actions
  - actions: quarantine, delete, remediate
  - anti-malware
    - generic term for bad software not to enter computers
    - including anti-virus (self-duplicated)


## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)

- Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
  - pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network
  - components
    - destination of network traffic, e.g., North Korea? Russia?
    - volume of outbound traffic,e.g., SFTP or email data from 100MB to 10GB
    - run as admin/sudo
    - SQL injection:
      - disk I/O w/ read volume or SQL monitoring
      - web server log
