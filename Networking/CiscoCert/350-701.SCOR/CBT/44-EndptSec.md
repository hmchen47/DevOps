Trainer: Keith Barker


## Introduction to Endpoint Security

- Learning goals
  - endpoint protection
  - mobile device management
  - MFA
  - posture assessment
  - patch management


## Why Endpoint Protection is Critical

- Endpoint protection overview
  - people prerequisite: training for social engineering, screen locking, etc.
  - network prerequisite: WSA, ESA, Umbrella, NGFW/IPS, Application Visibility & Control
  - purpose
    - improving security
    - compliance
    - risk management strategy
  - solution: AMP & AnyConnect
    - update periodically
    - limited right for access
    - posture: machine to meet the minimal requirements
      - OS-build
      - AV/AM updated to a certain date
      - registry, file, location, etc.
    - agent: permant or temporary
  - AnyConnect w/ ISE for identities


## The Value of Mobile Device Management

- Mobile device management (MDM)
  - devices: laptops w/ WiFi, mobile phones
  - locations: local or remote
  - on-board: brining on a mobile device into mobile device management system
  - inventory: the devices in MDM system
  - advantages
    - application protection: allowing to run on devices
    - data protection: enforcing encryption
    - malware/virus protection
    - identity management
    - provisioning: automatic and routine
    - templates: consistent policies
