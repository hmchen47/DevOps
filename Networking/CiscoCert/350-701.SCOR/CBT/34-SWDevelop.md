Trainer: Bart Castle



## Software and App Development Methodologies

- Software development methodologies
  - waterfall
  - agile
  - CI/CD
  - DevOps
  - DevSecOps


## Plan for Waterfall Method

- Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
  - planning
  - define requirements
  - design & prototyping
  - software development
  - testing
  - deployment
  - operations & maintenance


- Waterfall method overview
  - linear approach: move to next step until the current one completed
  - any change in the cycle $\to$ back to the requirements
  - five basic steps
    - requirements
      - stakeholder createing demand
      - demand translated into requirements
      - deliverables:
        - document to capture requirements
        - context: use cases, etc. to linerate the requirements
    - design
      - creating specifications according requirements
      - aspects of specs
        - physical - components, e.g., CPU, memory, network, and storage
        - logical - relations btw components and how to put them together
    - implementation
      - coding according specs
      - unit test
    - verification
      - testing: out of development environment
      - sign off to accept for release
    - maintenance
      - operating
      - measured w/ SLAs or metrics in requirements
  - disadvantages
    - ridgid: any change back to the begining of the procedure
    - long development time
