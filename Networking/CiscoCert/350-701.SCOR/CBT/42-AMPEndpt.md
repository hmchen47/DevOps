# 42. Understand and Configure AMP for Endpoints

Trainer: Knox Hutchinson


## Introducing Endpoint Security

- Learning goals
  - endpoint protection
  - advanced malware protection (AMP)
  - outbreak control
  - groups and policies



## The Types of Endpoint Protection

- Types of encpoint protection
  - endpoint prevention platforms (EPPs) 
    - stop file from entering the environment
    - anti-virus
    - anti-malware
    - action: quarantine, fix, delete
  - endpoint detection and response platforms (EDRs)
    - maintaining the security about the environment in an on-going monitoring way
    - point-in-time malicious
    - anomalous behavior
    - continuous monitoring
    - analytics ML and AI
    - centralized solution
    - focusing on protecting the endpoints
  - extended detection and response (XDR): integrating security across endpoints, cloud computing, email, and other solutions
  - Solution: Cisco AMP

## Introducing Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints

- Advanced Malware Protection (AMP)
  - AMP existed in network solutions, e.g., firewall, ESA, etc.
  - scanning file entering the system
  - endpoint solution
    - prevention: 
      - constantly updated
      - sanboxing: quarantine files
      - ML & AI 
    - detection
      - continuously monitoring
      - anomalous behavior
      - entering point and trajectory
    - response
      - contain/quarantine
      - telemetry: dashboard on threat overview on the whole network
