# 33. Cloud Service and Deployment Models

Trainer: Bart Castle


## Planning for loud Services

- Essential characteristics of could computing service by NIST
  - on-demand self-seervice: via API
  - broad network access
  - resource pooling: shared
  - rapid elasticity: vertical and horizontal scaling 
  - measured service: SLA, QoS


- Concerns of cloud services
  - CIA
    - confidentiality: who access the info
    - integrity: accuracy of info
    - availability: info available when needed
  - control
    - protective
    - detective
    - reactive
