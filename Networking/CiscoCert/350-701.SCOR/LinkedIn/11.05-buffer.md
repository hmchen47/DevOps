# Buffer overflow

Author: Charless Judd


- Buffer overflow
  - **Buffer**
    - area of temporary storage in physical memory
    - increasing efficiency and improving performance
    - example: streaming video buffering
  - **Buffer Overflow**
    - buffer filled to capacity and continuing to receive data
    - additional data written to adjacent memory
    - caused by errors in code or insufficient buffer size
    - resulting in unexpected bahavior, crashes, or specific undersired actions
    - one of the most common security vulnerability
    - example: WhatsApp vulnerability from 2019
    - C and C++ w/ high vulnerability rate
    - Linux, Windows, and Mac OS containing C and/or C++ code

- Types of buffer overflow attacks
  - **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow**
    - more common type of attack
    - last-in, first-out memory allocation
    - more predictable memory patterns
  - **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow**
    - unordered pool of memory for allocation
    - harder attack type to carry out
    - more difficult to invoke deliberate actions

- Buffer over mitigation
  - up-to-date patching and monitoring
  - secure software code development
    - Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
    - Data Execution Prevention
