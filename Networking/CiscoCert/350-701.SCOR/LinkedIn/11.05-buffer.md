# Buffer overflow

Trainer: Charless Judd


- **Buffer**
  - area of temporary storage in physical memory
  - increasing efficiency and improving performance
  - example: streaming video buffering
- **Buffer Overflow**
  - buffer filled to capacity and continuing to receive data
  - additional data written to adjacent memory
  - caused by errors in code or insufficient buffer size
  - resulting in unexpected bahavior, crashes, or specific undersired actions
  - one of the most common security vulnerability
  - example: WhatsApp vulnerability from 2019
  - C and C++ w/ high vulnerability rate
  - Linux, Windows, and Mac OS containing C and/or C++ code


- Types of buffer overflow attacks
  - **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow**
    - more common type of attack
    - last-in, first-out memory allocation
    - more predictable memory patterns
  - **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow**
    - unordered pool of memory for allocation
    - harder attack type to carry out
    - more difficult to invoke deliberate actions


- Buffer overflow mitigation
  - up-to-date patching and monitoring
  - secure software code development
    - Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
    - Data Execution Prevention
