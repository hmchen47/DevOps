- Demo: perform a HTTPS decryption
  - ensure the traffic encrypted, decrypted, blocked and alerted
  - <span style='color: cyan;'>Web Security Manager</span> tab > Web Policies > <span style='color: cyan;'>Decryption Policies</span>
  - Decryption Policies > Policies > fields - Group, URL Filtering, Web Reputation, Deafult Action, Delete > entry - Group = Global Policy, <span style='color: cyan;'>URL Filtering</span> = Minitor: 87 > `Monitor: 87' link
  - Description Policies: URL Filtering: Global Policy > sections - Custom and External URL Category Filtering, Predefined URL Categories Filtering
