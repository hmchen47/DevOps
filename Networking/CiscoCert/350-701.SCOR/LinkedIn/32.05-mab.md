# MAB

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Mac address bypass (MAB) overview
  - not all network device supporting 802.1x authentication, e.g., printers
  - solution: using MAB to bypass the network device but still secure ports
  - drop all frames except for the first frame
  - using the first frame to learn the MAC address
  - once learned, authenticator contacting Radius server to find the permission of the MAC address


- Demo: config MAB in ISE
  - 802.1x required to add switch to setup Radius authentication btw the switch and Cisco ISE
  - Policy tab > Policy Sets > entry - default: View = '>' > '>' icon
  - Authentication Policy > entries - MAB, VPN, Dot1X, Default
  - MAB entry: Use = Internal Endpoints, Options:
