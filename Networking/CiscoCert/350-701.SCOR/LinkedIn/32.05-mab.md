# MAB

Trainer: Charles Judd


- MAC address bypass (MAB) overview
  - not all network device supporting 802.1x authentication, e.g., printers
  - solution: using MAB to bypass the network device but still secure ports
  - drop all frames except for the first frame
  - using the first frame to learn the MAC address
  - once learned, authenticator contacting Radius server to find the permission of the MAC address


- Demo: config MAB in ISE
  - Policy tab > Policy Sets > entry - default: View = '>' > '>' icon
  - Authentication Policy > entries - MAB, VPN, Dot1X, Default
  - MAB entry: Use = Internal Endpoints, Condition = Wired_MAB OR Wireless_MAB -> ensure switch connected to ISE w/ 802.1x


- Demo: config 802.1X
  - 802.1x required to add switch to setup Radius authentication btw the switch and Cisco ISE
  - Administration tab > Network Resources > Network Devices
  - Network Devices > entry - Name = ams-3650-1, IP/Mask = 192.18.130.1/32, Type = Switches#Frabic#3650 > 'ams-3650-1' link
  - Network Devices: RADIUS Authentication Settings - configured -> associated w/ ISE


- Demo: viewing a MAB device
  - Context Visibility tab > Endpoints > entries w/ MAC address, IP Address, etc. > entry - MAC = 00:00:0E:2F:84:8A > '00:00:0E:2F:84:8A' link
  - 00:00:0E:2F:84:8A: tabs - Applications, Attributes, Authentication, Threats, Vulnerabilities
  - Attributes: sections - General Attributes, Custom Attributes, Other Attributes
    - General Attributes: Endpoint Policy = Fuji-Device
    - Other Attributes: AAA-Server = ise, AllowedProtocolMatchedRule = MAB


- Demo: add a new device w/ MAB
  - Endpoints: icons - refresh, +, edit, delete
    - '+' icon: register a new Aac address w/ ISE
  - enable MAB on switch port for this device connected
  - enter intf config mode and config a simple command MAB
  - supplicant endpoint no able to participate 802.1X identity exchange
  - switch sending a radius message to ISE to seek permission to join the network


- Demo: viewing the MAB authentication log
  - display the real time info about authentication for our identity
  - Operations tab > RADIUS > Live Logs > fields - Time, Status, Details, Repeat..., Identity, Endpoint ID, Endpoint Profile, Authentication Policy, Authorization Policy, Authorization Profiles
  - Authentication Polices: some 'Default>>Dot1x' and 'Default>>MAB' entries shown
