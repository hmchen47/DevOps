# HTTPS

Trainer: Charles Judd


- HTTP & HTTPS threats
  - one of the data exfiltration methods
  - mainly using backdoor


- Backdoor
  - unauthorized, on-demand access to a system
  - linked to many well known attacks
  - typically created by malware installed onto a device
  - main goal: be discreet


- HTTP exfiltration
  - HTTP probably used to transmit data from the affected client to a malicious server
  - high volume of HTTP traffic seen on a typically enterprise network $\to$ hiding data exflitration
  - larger transgers going unnoticed


- HTTP exfiltration threats
  - HTTP POST requests used to send files
  - data probably encoded or compressed to minimize detection using this plain text protocols
  - web proxy devices able to detect encoding


- HTTPS exfiltration threats
  - HTTPS often preferred over HTTP
  - HTTPS data encrypted and unreadable under normal circumstances
  - requiring a device capable of TLS interception


- HTTPS extfilitration solution
  - TLS interception able to negatively impact performance and using valuable system resources
  - solution: Cisco StealWatch
    - leveraging encrypted traffic analysis
    - able to identify malware communications via passive monitoring than decrypting the traffic for examination
    - using ML algorithms to piinpoint malicious patterns inside the encrypted traffic
