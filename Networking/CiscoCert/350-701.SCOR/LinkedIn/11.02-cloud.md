# Cloud-based threats

Author: Charles Judd


- Termonologies for cloud-based threats
  - **Public Cloud Deployment**
    - most common method of cloud computing
    - example: Microsoft Azure
    - cloud resources owned and operated by a 3rd-party service provider
    - lower cost, less maintenance
    - higher reliability, easier to scale
  - **Private Cloud Deployment**
    - resources owned ad operated by the organization
    - common w/ government agencies and banks
    - hosted locally or w/ 3rd-party provider
    - improved security and control
    - more flexible to a business specific needs
  - **Hybrid Cloud Deployment**
    - combining public and private cloud features
    - balance of cost-effectiveness, control, and flexibility
  - **Data Breaches**
    - ensuring cloud providers equiped to prevent and contain a data breach
    - checking data policy thoroughly
    - inquiring about incident response procedures
    - considering industry-specific reqgulatory requirements, e.g., HIPAA in Heath industry
    - encryption implementation
  - **User Misconfiguration**
    - attributed to over 21% of breaches in 2019
    - customer w/ the responsibility in the public cloud
    - importance: thorough understanding of cloud security deployment
  - **Insecure Application Programming Interface (API)**
    - API security: one of the most frequent attack vectors
    - critical: authentication, access control, activity monitoting, and encryption
    - Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI)
    - Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI)
  - **DoS and DDoS**
    - designed to disrupt or disable a network
    - cloud provider Service Level Agreement (SLA)
    - SLA varying btw providers
  - **Compromised Credentials**
    - credential management control depending on how cloud resources are used
    - compromise detection becoming commonplace
    - leaked credential monitoring
