# Cisco pxGrid

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Cisco Platform Exchange Grid (pxGrid) overview
  - a data sharing and threat control platform
  - integrating multiple security products
  - bi-directional exchange info w/o relying on product specific AIPs
  - systems integrated including security monitoring systems, detection systems, access management platforms, amd more items


- pxGrid API on ISE
  - using ISE as an internal certificate authority to create a pxGrid certificate
  - pxGrid
    - essentially a set of API to interact w/ multiple platforms using certificates to achieve secure communication
    - version 1.0: using C / Java SDK
    - version 2.0: using WebSocket and REST API over the STOMP messaging protocol to query and subscribe to 'topics'
  - no existing certificate infrastructure for issuing certificates $\to$ using Cisco ISE as an internal certificate authority to create a pxGrid certificate
  - subscribing a topic: subscribing to a set of info from another security device to be shared
  - adding a particiapant
    - one more secure device sharing info btw
    - installing pxGrid certificate on the devices
    - config the device to point to the IP of the pxGrid controllers, e.g., ISE (the controller)
    - generate a new certificate of the new device, such as FirePOWER instance (the participant)
    - download the certificate from the controller and install into the participate device, i.e., FirePOWER
    - the procedure allowing user to use the certificate pointing to ISE and then to share btw these security appliances


- Demo: verify ISE pxGrid function
  - ISE dashboard: tabs - Home, Context Visibility, Operations, Policy, Administration, Work Centers
  - Home tab: subtabs - System, Identity Management, Network Resources, Device Portal Management, pxGrid Services, Feed Services, Threat Centric NAC
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Home</span> tab > System > Deployment
  - Deployment: folders - Deployment, PAN Failover > Deployment Nodes: fields - Hostname, Personas, Roles(s), Service
  - entry - Hostname = ise24, Personas = Administration, Monitoring, Policy, Service, pxGrid > 'ise24' link
  - Deployment Nodes List > ise24 > Edit Node: tabs - General Settings, Profiling Configuration
  - General Information > pxGrid = On (button of the page) -> enable pxGrid controller function on ISE


- Demo: generate pxGrid certificate
  - Administration tab > pxGrid Services: subtabs - All Clients, Web Clients, Capabilities, Live Log, Settings, Certificates, Permissions
  - Certificates subtab > Certificates  > Generate pxGrid Certificates
