# File transfer protocols

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Common File Transfer Protocols
  - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  - Secure Shell (SSH)
  - Secure FTP (SFTP)
  - Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)


- File transfer protocols
  - built-in to many popular OS
  - FTP available in Windows and Linux systems
  - no additional software required for file transfer


- FTP exfiltration
  - 'blind drop' server
  - attacker creating ftp server w/ write-only permission
  - permitting anonymous uploads


- SFTP and SCP
  - encrypted protocols
  - harder to detect what type of data being transferred


- File transfer protocol issues
  - many enterprise defense mechanisms focused on keeping malicious traffic from entering a network
  - exfiltration preventon as a less common consideration
  - common usage of file transfer protocols means these are often unchecked and allowed by default


- Exfiltration considerations
  - port control and an awareness of protocols are essential
  - Solution: Cisco StealthWatch
    - leveraging Secure Network Analytics, a ML engine
    - Secure Network Analytics sued to discover threats and malicious communication
    - continuously watching user and device behavior on the network
    - determining what the normal baseline behavior is
    - behavior modeling used to detect any anomalous behavior
    - anomalous behavior triggering alarms
    - specific alarms geared towarding indentity exfiltration
    - alarm allowing to view contexture info about the host, inscluing username, Mac address, location, etc.
    - able to quarantine the exfiltration for further investigation
