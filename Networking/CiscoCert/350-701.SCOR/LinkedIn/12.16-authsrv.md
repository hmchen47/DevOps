# TACACS+ and RADIUS

Trainer: Charles Judd


- The AAA architecture
  - a framework for admin to control user access to network devices
  - 3 security functions
    - authentication
      - proof of identity
      - username/password
    - authorization
      - privileges and restrictions
      - authentication not ensuring authorization
    - accounting
      - record of user actions
      - log files, include time, actions, etc.
  - methods: external and internal


- External AAA devices
  - RADIUS
    - IETF open standard
    - UDP port 1812/1813
    - encrypting password field only
    - purpose: network access
    - 3 functions combined
  - TACACS+
    - Cisco-proprietary
    - encrypting entire payload
    - TCP port 49
    - purpose: device adminstration
    - 3 functions separated


- Cisco Identity Service Engine (ICE)
  - mid to large environment
  - both Radius and TACACS+


- Config external AAA device
  - routers
  - AAA server


- Demo: config AAA w/ local fallback
  - enter aaa config mode (global mode): `R1(config)# aaa new-model`
  - config a user as a fallback method: `R1(config)# username charles privilege 15 secret cisco`
  - config to access tacacs+ server
