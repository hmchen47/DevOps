# IPsec

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Virtual private networks (VPN)
  - using IPsec protocols
  - providing secure services to traffic btw two trusted systems or networks
  - usually connected to public networks
  - offerring cost saving and simplifying scalability
  - compitable to wide ranged WAN options
  - types of VPN covered in SCOR
    - site-to-site IPsec VPN
    - remote-access IPsec VPN


- Site-to-site IPsec VPN
  - an extension of classical WAN model
  - commonly used to connect to multiple sites geographically separated
  - example: headquater and branch offices in other cities
  - TCP/IP traffic passed through VPN tunnel over public Internet
  - VPN gateways providing secure service at border, e.g. Cisco ASA firwalls


- Remote-access IPsec VPN
  - involving dialog connection technologies
  - supporting the needs of external clients
  - usually requiring VPN client software 
    - authenticate user
    - establish IPsec VPN connection
  - IPsec used to authenticate and encrypt traffic over the Internet
  - clientless SSL VPN
    - implemented w/ SSL
    - client software not required
    - allowing uses to connect to public addresses via VPN gateway
    - most commonly seen on web browser via HTTPS protocol
  

- IPsec main protocols
  - Encapsulating Security Palyload (ESP)
  - Authenticaton Header (AH)


- Authentication Header (AH)
  - authenticating IP traffic
  - verifying traffic source
  - no encryption
  - key has function using HMAC (keyed hash message authentication code)
  - MD5 and SHA supported
  - creating a message digest output used for authentication


- Encrypting Security Payload (ESP)
  - adding confidentiality through encryption
  - optionally providing authentication
  - supporting symmetric encryption, including DES, 3DES, and AES
  - adding ESP header and trailer to packets
  - modes supported
    - transport mode: playload encrypted
    - tunnel mode: entire packet encrypted
  - authentication used w/ encryption $\to$ the encryption step performed first


- ESP and AH modes
  - tunnel mode
  - transport mode

- Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
  - framework provided by the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)
  - two phases
    - phase 1:
      - main mode (6 steps) or aggressive mode (3 steps)
      - a security tunnel established
    - phase 2:
      - quick mode (2 steps)
      - IPsec tunnel established

- IKEv1 Phase 1 main mode
  - 1\. negotiate security policy (step 1 & 2)
    - policy used for ISAKMP Security Association (SA)
    - SSA: a key used btw peers how they communicate each other
    - 5 parameres to match: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">HAGLE</span>
      - H = Hash algorithm
      - A = Authentication method
      - G = Group number
      - L = Lifetime value
      - E = Encryption algorithm
  - 2\. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (step 3 & 4)
    - establishing a public key (nonces) over insecure public Internet
    - Nonces: random prime integers exchanged for identity proof
  - 3\. Peer Identity Validation (step 5 & 6)
    - done by pre-shared key or digital certificate


- IKEv1 Phase 1 aggressive mode
  - 1\. SA data
    - send by client
    - passing data required for security association w/ clear text message
    - info incliding identity info, IKE policy, etc.
  - 2\. proposal
    - responder authenticate the packet
    - sending back proposal
  - 3\. session authentication
  - agressive mode using clear-text exchanges


- IKEv1 Phase 2 quick mode
  - negotiateing IPsec security association
  - IPsec SA negotiation: IPsec transforma set
    - data encryption
    - data authentication
    - encryption mode
  - IPsec trunnel established
