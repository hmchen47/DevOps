Trainer: Charles Judd


- Web Authentication (WebAuth) overview
  - clients w/o 802.1x supplicant software
  - able to be used as primary or fallback method of authentication
  - MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) taking priority
  - users redirected to a web portal for credential verification
  - credentials forwarded to RADIUS server
  - only working for clients w/ web browser access


- Types of WebAuth
  - local WebAuth (LWA)
    - original WebAuth standard
    - switch or WLC redirecting to web portal
    - portal hosted on switch or WLC
    - no portal customization
    - no VLAN assignment
  - centralized WenAuth (CWA)
    - appliance such as Cisco ISE
    - VLAN assignment
    - customizable web portal
    - acceptable use policy display
    - security posture assessment


- Demo: verify central WebAuth (CWA) config

  - Authorization > Authorization Profiles: fields - Name, Profile, Description > entry - Name = Cisco_WebAuth > 'Cisco_WebAuth' link
  - Authorization Profile: Name = Cisco_WEbAuth; Description = <span style="color: cyan;">Default Profile used to redirect users to the CWA portal.</span>; Common Tasks: Web Redirection (CWA, MDM, NSP, CPP) = On, Centralized Web Auth, ACL = ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT, value = Self-Registered Guest Portal

  - Administration tab > Network Resources: sidetabs - Network Device, Default Device, Device Security Settings > Network Devices: fields - IP/Mask, Profile Name, Location, Type > 'Type' to search for wireless fabric > entry - IP/Mask = 198.18.130/32, Profile Name = Cisco > circle icon to display in page windowlet
  - Cisco: Services = Radius, TACACS, TrustSec, MAB, 802.1X, WebAuth; CoA = RFC, Port Bounce, Port Shutdown, Re-Auth, RFC Push; Native URL = Dynamic
