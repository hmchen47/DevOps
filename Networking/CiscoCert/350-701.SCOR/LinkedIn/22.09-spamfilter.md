- Typical ESA mail flow
  - external sender emails 'support@kwtrain.com'
  - sender's emails server performs MX record search
  - hostname of Cisco ESA is returned (e.g., 'mail.kwtrain.com')
  - sender's server also queries DNS server fro the IP address associated w/ 'mail.kwtrain.com'
  - sender's mail server opens SMTP connection w/ Cisco ESA
  - ESA helps incoming mail against policies and delivers to internal email server, if acceptable
  - internal user's email client will retrieve message from internal mail server using POP or IMAP
