# Cross-site request forgery

Trainer: Charles Judd

- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  - a way for attacker to force a trust user to perform an unauthorized and unintended action
  - also called "Session Riding" attacks
  - legitimate user w/ trusted session fooled into performing unwanted actions
  - examples: changing email, password, or bank transfer
  - typically affecting apps or web sites where HTTP requests sent to a target
  - example:
    - legitimate transfer request: `GET http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=JohnDoe&amount=$100 HTTP/1.1`
    - unauthorized transfer request: `GET http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=Attacker&amount=$100 HTTP/1.1`
    - the request sent within established secure session
    - commonly embedding a code in the web site controlled by attacker
    - or sending email or social link in message
    - or embedding a request in hyperlink: `<a href="http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=Attacker&amount=$100">Click to Unsubscribe</a>`


- Requirements for CSRF
  - relevant and reproducible action
  - cookie-based session handling
  - no unknown request parameters required


- Web application CSRF prevention
  - using REST-ful (Representational State Transfer) design for web applications
    - an architecture outlines good design for the web applications
    - implementing GET request only allows for viewing the resources
  - generation of random, unique tokens for every session request


- End-user mitigation od CSRF attacks
  - not staying logged in to idle web application
  - not storing usernames and passwords in browser
  - not browsing while logged into a sensitive app
  - secure username and passwords
