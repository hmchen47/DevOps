# Indication of compromise (IOC)

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Indication of compromise (IOC) overview
  - data able to identify specific info related to
    - malicious files
    - behavior of the network
    - any abnormal behavior
  - defining key aspects of the endpoint policies as an indicator of IOC


- Demo: create new or edit existed IOC
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Outbreak Control</span> tab > Outbreak Control tab: CUSTOM DETECTION - Simple, Advanced, Android; APPLICATION CONTROL - Blocked Applications, Allowed Applications; NETWORK - IP Block & Allow Lists; ENDPOINT IOC - Scan Summary
  - Outbreak Control tab > <span style="color: cyan;">CUSTOM DETECTION</span> > Simple > Custom Detection - Simple: entries of custom detections
    - view existing: entry - test > 'Edit' button > side element w/ tabs - Add SHA-246, Upload File, Upload Set of SHA-256 > Add SHA-256 tab > Update Name = test; File Included -> details of the attached file shown
    - create new: Custom Detection - Simple > 'Create' button > New = cj-test > 'Save' button > top of the list shown the entry > 'Edit' button to upload file(s) or add signature for the new custom detection entry to quarantine
    - new top entry - Update Name = cj-test; tabs - Add SHA-256, Upload File, Upload Set of SHA-256
  - Outbreak Control tab > CUSTOM DETECTION > Advanced > Custom Detection - Advanced > more signature types
    - 'Create Signature Set' button > Name = cj-test > 'Save' button > entry shown on top > 'Edit' button
    - `Add Signature' button > Signature = ..., Type = Auto detect or select from drop down box
  - CUSTOM DETECTION > Android > Custom Detection - Android: dedicated section for Android w/ .apk extention files


- Demo: IP access list control to block a list of network
  - Outbreak Control tab > <span style="color: cyan;">NETWORK - IP Block & Allow Lists</span> > Network - IP Block & Allow Lists: tabs - All IP Lists, IP Block Lists, IP Allow List, Isolation IP Allow Lists > All IP Lists: section - IP Blacklists: IPs and CIDR Blocks = 192.168.01.0/24 & 192.168.2.0/23, Used in Groups = None, Usd in Policies = None; buttons - Replace, Export, Edit, Delete > 'Edit' button to change the settings


- Demo: viewing IOC info
  - Analysis tab > Events
  - Outbreak Control tab > ENDPOINT IOC > Endpoint IOC - Scan Summary
  - Analysis tab > Indicators > list of IOC files
    - the most right column: color buttons to indicate the security levels - Low, Medium, High, Critical
    - the info feed used by Cisco AMP to protect end points
