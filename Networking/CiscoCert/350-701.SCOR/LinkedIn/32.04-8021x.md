# 802.1X

Trainer: Charles Judd


- 802.1X overview
  - a standard for network access control
  - predominantly used in wireless networks
  - ensuring the network disconnected until authentication is completed
  - roles
    - supplicant
    - authenticator
    - authentication server

- Supplicant
  - supplicant software
  - native in many OS
  - sending identity credentials to the authenticator


- Authenticator
  - contolling network access
  - switch or WLC commonly
  - receiving EAP packets and re-encapsulating as RADIUS


- Authentication server
  - RADIUS server
  - validating client identity
  - responding w/ accept or deny message


- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods
  - always carried by another protocol
  - most commonly based on Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  - choosing based on security requirements and endpoint support
  - methods:
    - inner methods: tunnel within the tunneled outer methods
    - tunnel (transport) methods:
      - using an outer TLS tunnel btw supplicant and the authentication server
      - similar to an HTTPS session establishment

- EAP authentication methods - most common ones
  - EAP-MD5
    - using MD5 algorithm for hashing
    - one-way authentication where only the supplicant is validated
  - EAP-TLS
    - mutual authentication btw client and server
    - supplicant and server both assigned a digital certificate
    - most secure, but most involved administratively
  - Protected EAP (PEAP)
    - only requiring the authentication server to have a digital certificate
    - creating TLS tunnel btw client and server
    - less of an administrative burden


- Protected EAP (PEAP) inner methods
  - a tunnel established w/ TLS as the outer method
  - an inner method used to pass credentials via outer TLS tunnel
  - EAP-MSCHAPv2
    - most commonly used
    - used for communication within an MSCHAPv2 session
    - using simple username and password to communicate w/ a Radius server
    - able to authenticate using MS AD info
  - EAP-GTC
    - alternative to MSCHAPv2
    - allowing for more generic authentication using E directory, LDAP, token servers and more
  - EAP-TLS
    - a TLS tunnel running within an outer TLS tunnel
    - most secure option but rarely used due to complexity


- Outer methods
  - EAP-FAST
    - Cisco's alternative to Protected EAP (PEAP)
    - fatser rea-authentication and wireless roaming
    - Protected Access Credentials (PACs) store locally, similar to cookie
  - EAP-TTLS
    - functionally similar to Protected EAP (PEAP) but less supported
    - inner authentication methods other than EAP-based methods
    - PAP, CHAP, and MS-CHAP
