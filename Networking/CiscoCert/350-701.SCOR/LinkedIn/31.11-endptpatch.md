# Endpoint patching

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Endpoint patching benefits
  - security from known vulnerabilities
  - known vulnerabilities offer a well documented and legitimate attack vector
  - ensure endpoints fall under compliance regulations


- Best practices of endpoint patching
  - accurate inventory critical for ensuring protection
  - using automated patch management tools
  - using endpoint status reporting
  - testing patches in a sandbox environmen before deployment
  - checking for unexpected or adverse consequence
  - test rollback abilities of patches
  - subscribing to vendor security feeds
  - consider using consolidated feeds, such as the National Vulnerability Database from NIST
  - pare down announcements and alerts to only those needed
  - consolidating software when possible
  - multiple versions of a software meaning more vulnerabilities
  - assigning assets to a risk category
  - understanding which systems are most critical
  - more exposed assets should get priority patching
