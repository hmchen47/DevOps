Trainer: Charles Judd


- Service layers of NIST cloud computing reference architecture
  - SaaS
  - PaaS
  - IaaS

  <figure style="margin: 0.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img style="margin: 0.1em; padding-top: 0.5em; width: 20vw;"
      onclick= "window.open('page')"
      src    = "img/21.02-srvlayers.png"
      alt    = "text"
      title  = "text"
    />
  </figure>


- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - virtual provisioning of resources available over the Internet
  - allowing for virtual infrastructure
  - resources including compute, networking, and storage
  - more economical than onsite data center
  - prociders including AWS, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure, etc.


- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - typically used for app creation and testing
  - developers interacting w/ PaaS
  - supporting complete web application lifecycle
  - offering development tools for quick coding
  - able to be used for cross-platform development
  - developer collaboration as an upside to PaaS


- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - quick access to cloud-based web applications
  - many different end users
  - proviers including Dropbox, Cisco WebEx, Office 365, etc.


- Analogy btw cloud service and car
  - IaaS - Car lease
  - PaaS - Car rental
  - SaaS - Taxi
