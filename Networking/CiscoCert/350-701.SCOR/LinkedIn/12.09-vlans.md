# VLANs

Trainer: Chrles Judd


- Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
  - logically group devices into broadacast domains
  - adding flexibility and security in a network design
  - ability to span multiple switches


- Types of VLAN connections
  - access mode interface
    - belonging to a single VLAN
    - end device connections using access mode
    - default mode, also called 'untagged port'
  - trunk mode interface
    - not assigned to a specific VLAN
    - carrying traffic from multiple designated VLANs
    - tagged port
    - tagged by ISL or 802.1q


- Native VLAN
  - used exclusively w/ 802.1Q
  - set to VLAN 1 by default
  - native VLAN traffic untagged
  - best security pratice: change Native VLAN value
    - VLAN 1 as a well known security hole
    - e.g., exploited w/ VLAN hopping attacks


- Demo: VLAN config
  - topology: 

    <figure style="margin: 0.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
      <img style="margin: 0.1em; padding-top: 0.5em; width: 30vw;"
        onclick= "window.open('page')"
        src    = "img/12.09-vlan.png"
        alt    = "VLAN topology for demo"
        title  = "VLAN topology for demo"
      />
    </figure>
