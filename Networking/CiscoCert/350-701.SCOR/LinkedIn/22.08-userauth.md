# User authentication

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Authentication on WSA
  - tracking user activity
  - integrating w/ existing authentication infrastructure, e.g., AD instances
  - implementing policy-based on users and groups as oppose to IP address
  - checking user authentication before giving access privilege to the network


- Demo: setup authentication w/ existing AD
  - WSA dashboard > Network tab > Identification Services > Authentication
  - Authentication: sections - Authentication Realms, Global Authentication Settings > Authentication Realms > 'Add Realm...' button
  - Add Realm: sections - Authentication Realm, LDAP Authentication, User / Group Queries 
    - Authentication Realm: Realm Name = SCOR; Authentication Server Type and Scheme(s) = LDAP (Basic Authentication)
    - LDAP Authentication: LDAP Server = '10.1.1.50:389' (389 - normal LDAP, 636 - LDAP over SSL); Query Credentials: Use Bind DN = On, Bind DN = 'cisco\admin', Passphrase = 'xxxx';  Base DN = 'dc=cisco, dc=com'
    - 'Submit' button
    - Authentication > Success - The LDAP Realm "SCOR" was added.
  
  
- Demo: change global setting if needed
  - Authentication: 'Edit Global Settings' button
  - Edit Global Authentication Settings: sections - Global Authentication Settings, Authentication Settings
    - Global Authentication Settings: Action if Authentication Service Unavailable = Block all traffic if authentication fails; Log Guest User by = (*)IP address / User Name as Entered by End-User
    - Authentication Settings (if HTTPS): Use encrypted HTTPS connection for authentication = On; HTTPS Redirect Port = 443; 'Advanced' button to display certificate info


- Demo: add LDAP Realm as identity
  - WSA dashboard > Web Security Manager tab > Authentication > Identification Profiles
  - Identification Profiles: 'Add Identification Profile...' button
  - Identification Profile: Add Profile > sections - Client / User Identification Profile Settings, User Identification Method, Membership Definition
    - Client / User Identification Profile Settings: Name = SCOR
    - User Identification Method: Identification and Authentication = 'Exempt from authentication / identification' / ('*')'Authenticate Users'; Select a Realm or Sequence = SCOR; Authentication Surrogates = IP Address / Persistent Cookie / (`*`) Session Cookie
    - Membership Definition: Define Members by Protocol = HTTP/HTTPS
    - 'Submit' button > Warning - The policy group "SCOR Profile"  was added. (above Global Profile)
  - NB: order of profiles affects the priority of the execution
