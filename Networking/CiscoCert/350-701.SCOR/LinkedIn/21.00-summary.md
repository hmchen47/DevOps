# Cloud Security


## Public, private, hybrid, and community clouds


- NIST SP 500-322
  - outlining cloud service modes
  - describing deployment strategies

- Factors for cloud popularity
  - distributed storage for data protection
  - easily scaled out
  - automated mgmt capabilities
  - accessing from any location
  - etc.


- Essential characteristics of NIST doc
  - on-demand self-service
  - broad network access
  - resource pooling
  - rapid elasticity
  - measured service


- On-demand self-service
  - requested resource automatically processed
  - no human intervention need
  - e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - faster and more flexible than traditional deployment


- Broad network access
  - cloud resources available on a wide range of devices
  - such as PCs, Macs, tablets, smartphones, etc.


- Resource pooling
  - provider compute resource pooled together
  - resources: storage, processor, memory, and infastructure
  - offering cost saving vs. having dedicated per-customer hardware deployments


- Rapid elasticity
  - provisioning and tearing down resources quickly
  - ability to commision or decommision services as needed


- Measured service
  - cloud provider monitoring offered services
  - measuring usage-based plans
  - providing service performance assurance


- Cloud deployment models
  - private cloud
  - public cloud
  - community cloud
  - hybrid cloud


- Private cloud
  - resource used exclusively by one client
  - onsite datacenter or 3rd-party hosting
  - more privacy and security control
    - popular compliance models, such as SOX, PCI, and HIPAA
  - more expensive to deploy and maintain
  - common in sectors where security and privacy is valued, e.g. financial institutions


- Public cloud
  - provisoned for open use
  - resources owned by 3rd-party and shared over the Internet
  - examples: AWS, Azure, Dropbox, etc.
  - cost effective solution for users
  - security and privacy responsibility largely on CSP
  - compliance regulation issues, e.g. HIPAA w/ PCI DSS


- Community cloud
  - private cloud model variation
  - cloud providers catering to specific sectors
  - no concrete standards outlined for this model


- Hybrid cloud
  - combining two or more cloud models
  - able to combine benefits offered by different models
  - initial deployment costs higher than public model
  - implemention possible complex



## Cloud service models


- Service layers of NIST cloud computing reference architecture
  - SaaS
  - PaaS
  - IaaS

  <figure style="margin: 0.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img style="margin: 0.1em; padding-top: 0.5em; width: 450px;"
      onclick= "window.open('page')"
      src    = "img/21.02-srvlayers.png"
      alt    = "Cloud service layers"
      title  = "Cloud service layers"
    />
  </figure>


- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - virtual provisioning of resources available over the Internet
  - allowing for virtual infrastructure
  - resources including computing, networking, and storage
  - more economical than onsite data center
  - prociders including AWS, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure, etc.


- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - typically used for app creation and testing
  - developers interacting w/ PaaS
  - supporting complete web application lifecycle
  - offering development tools for quick coding
  - able to be used for cross-platform development
  - developer collaboration as an upside to PaaS


- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - quick access to cloud-based web applications
  - many different end users
  - proviers including Dropbox, Cisco WebEx, Office 365, etc.


- Analogy btw cloud service and car
  - IaaS - Car lease
  - PaaS - Car rental
  - SaaS - Taxi





## Customer vs. provider responsibility


- Shared security responsibility
  - varying depending on cloud service model
  - CSPs typically outlining models for customers
  - important to understand when choosing a service model
  - customers taking full responsibility for private clouds
  - examples:
    - [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
    - [Shared responsibility in the cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility)

  </a>
</div>

- Shared security responsibility - SaaS
  - customer w/ least amount of responsibility
  - provider responsible for infrastructure and software stack
  - customer managing users and access
  - provider responsible: data security within the SaaS
  - customer's security responsibility: anything downloaded locally from SaaS


- Shared security responsibility - PaaS
  - customer responsible for users, data, and applications
  - provider responsible for infrastructure and software stack
  - provider responsible for any built-in applications or modules
  - customer responsible for security of any software built w/ PaaS


- Shared security responsibility - IaaS
  - most clear-cut distinction of responsibility
  - provider responsible for infrastructure and software stack
  - customer responsible for any applications or data on the platform



## Patch management


- Patch management
  - process of applying software updates
  - creating vulnerabilities and/or bugs
  - general improvements to functionality
  - important for security and regulation compliance
  - responsibilities depending on the cloud model
  - inquiring w/ CSPs about patching cycles, potential downtime, and service scalability


- SaaS patch management
  - minimum customer responsibility
  - providers patching all software and hardware
  - lower mgmt load for customers vs. maintaining their own infrastructure


- PaaS patch management
  - most complex service model for patch mgmt
  - providers pacthing underlying software and hardware
  - customers patching application and environment components created
  - typical to see a security team work w/ developers for PaaS patch mgmt


- IaaS patch management
  - model w/ the least customer responsibility
  - provider patching underlying software and hardware
  - customers patching anything deployed on IaaS
  - customers responsible for VMs, applications, virtual network infrastructure, etc.

## Application and data security


- Security testing
  - static application security testing (SAST)
  - dynamic application security testing (DAST)


- Static application security testing
  - 'white box' testing method

  - typical developer approach to testing
  - using analysis against source code to test for vulnerabilities w/o executing the application
  - generally help to find vulnerabilities earlier
  - unable to discover runtime and environment-related issues


- Dynamic application security testing
  - 'black box' testing method
  - test from the outside-in, w/ no knowledge of the technology or underlying framework
  - typical pentration tester approach
  - testing executed against the application itself
  - finding vulnerabilities after development cycle completed
  - issues corrected w/ vulnerability patches


- SAST and DAST
  - not an either/or situation
  - comprehensive security: both types of testing used
  - example tools:
    - 'Find Security Bugs': find bugs in applications w/ Java
    - 'snoarqube': find vulnerabilities in coding for many different languages
