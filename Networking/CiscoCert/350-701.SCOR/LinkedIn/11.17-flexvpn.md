# FlexVPN

Trainer: Charles Judd


- FlexVPN
  - new version of IPsec tunnel w/ IKEv2 protocol
  - goal: simplify the deployment of various VPN peers, includeing site-to-site VPN and DMVPN
  - creating a unified set of command for setup
  - funcationally identical to DMVPN
    - all pieces found in DMVPN config still available
    - inclding point-to-point GRE tunnels btw devices and dynamic tunels btw spoke sites via NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol)

- DMVPN vs FlexVPN

  - IKEv2 offering many enhancements, including
    - EAP authentication
    - less bandwidth consumption
    - built-in NAT-T
    - etc.


- Tunnel types of FlexVPN
  - Static virtual Tunnel Interface (sVTI)
    - configured same as any GRE tunnel
    - configured on spoke router, pointing to hub
  - Dynamic Virtual-Template
    - template configuration on hub router
      - a copy of an existing interface used
      - not futher config required
    - allowing for dynamic interface creation on spoke
      - spoke side requesting a tunnel connection to the hub
      - a virtual tunnel dynamically created based on the settings in the virtual template
    - able to accommodate all types of VPN connection
    - terminating when no longer needed
    - allowing to configure virtual template on spokes
      - dynamic spoke to spoke tunnel creation allowed
    - able to add AAA and authorization policy info to template
      - customized the virtual tunnel session based on identity of the spoke peer


- Dual-hub high availability deployment of FlexVPN
  - achieved w/ two hub routers $\to$ redundancy
  - spoke router able to use IP SLA to detect change
    - tracking objects to detect an event where the main hub unavailable
    - allowing to change over to the other hub
  - common solution in data center environment
    - remote access w/ a high availability rate and a minimal downtime
  - allowing for redundancy and network recovery
    - once main router down due to an unexpected power issue, a reload, or service

- Types of FlexVPN deployment
  - single cloud deployment
    - easier to configure
    - slower recover time based on an object tracking or dead peer detection
    - only one active tunnel to the hub at any given time
    - failover to the other hub in the event of failure
    - HQ2 as backup hub $\to$ dotted green lines as redundant connection and not active at the moment
    - HQ1 failure $\to$ failover to HQ2 as the backup hub
  - dural cloud deployment
    - allowing for load sharing
    - faster failure recovery depending on routing protocol timers
