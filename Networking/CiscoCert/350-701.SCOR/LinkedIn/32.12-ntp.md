# NTP

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Network time protocol (NTP) overview
  - time synchronization critical for management, security, planning, and debugging
  - regulated under policies such as SOX and HIPAA


- NTP exfiltration
  - unprotected NTP packets able to be dropped or modified, leading to degradation
  - NTP packet contents able to be altered or pointed to a rough server


- NTP exfiltration protection
  - using well known UDP port 123
  - common to synchronize w/ an Internet Time Server
  - dedicated network time servers on the local network able to ensure port 123 is not public exposed


- NTP best practices
  - explicitly config a trusted time source
  - using NTP authentication
  - using ACLs to limit the availability of NTP info only to valid network clients
  - closing UDP port 123 for Internet-facing devices that does not require time synchronization
