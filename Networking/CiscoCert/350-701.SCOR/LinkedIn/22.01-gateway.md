# Secure internet gateway

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)
  - main goal: protection from malicious websites and malware
  - acting as a proxy for web requests
  - virtual or physical appliance deployed inside edge firewall device
  - modes of deployment: explicit forward mode and transparent mode


- Cisco WSA explicit forward mode
  - clients explicitly pointed toward WSA proxy
  - WSA responsible for DNS resolution
  - requiring each individual client to configured to point to the proxy


- Cisco WSA transparent mode - preferred
  - clients unaware of a proxy in the network path
  - other infrastructure devices redirected to WSA
  - firewall redirecting client requests to WSA
  - WSA verifying URL request and determining risk
    - no violation: connection initiated to URL from the WSA
    - violation: WSA checking content against security policy, and forwarding to client or blocking based on results


- Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP)
  - Cisco propriety
  - available on Cisco ASAs, routers, and switches
  - allowing routing platforms to transparently redirect packets to the other destinations

- Demo: config firewall for transparent proxy using WCCP
  - topology:
    - firwall: 10.1.1.1
    - WSA addr: 10.1.1.100
  - config procedure
    - 1\. config ACL to allow traffic on the subnet and WSA host
    - 2\. config WCCP redirection
    - 3\. enter outgoing intf to config
    - 4\. enable WCCP to redirect traffic to WSA
  - config ACL for web traffic:
    - ACL named HTTP & HTTPS to allow HTTP & HTTPS traffic from the subnet to any outside network w/ traffic designatd port
    - WCCP redirect list: where to send the traffic if matched, named WSA, sending ant traffic on the host to any destination

    ```bash
    ASA(config)# access-list HTTP permit tcp 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 any eq http
    ASA(config)# access-list HTTPS permit tcp 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 any eq https
    ASA(config)# access-list WSA permit ip host 10.1.1.100 any
    ```
  
  - config WCCP redirection for HTTP: `ASA(config)# wccp 10 redirect-list HTTP group-list WSA`
    - `10`: service identifier
    - `redirect-list`: the access-list used to permit redirection
    - `group-list`: the access-list used to permit group membership
  - config WCCP redirection for HTTPS: `ASA(config)# wccp 20 redirect-list HTTPS group-list WSA`
  - enable the redirection for WCCP on the source intf of the firewall: `ASA(config)# int g0/0`
  - assign the intf name: `ASA(config-if)# nameif` $\to$ `Note: Security level for "inside" set to 100 by default`
    - `nameif`: giving a name and assign a security level
    - typically names: outside, inside, or DMZ
  - config the inside intf for WCCP redirection w/ HTTP: `ASA(config)# wccp interface inside 10 redirect in`
    - `inside`: name of the interface
    - `redirect`: packet redirection options for the service
    - `in`: redirect to a Cache  appropriate ingress packets
  - config the inside intf for WCCP redirection w/ HTTPS: `ASA(config)# wccp interface inside 20 redirect in`
  - configuration on different devices
    - routers: commands essentially identical
    - switches: config at interface VLAN level than a named interface


- Demo: config WSA appliance for transparent proxy
  - dashboard > Transparent Redirection
  - Transparent redirection > 'Edit Device...' button
  - Edit Transaprent Redirection Device > Type = WCCP v2 Router > 'Submit' button
  - Transparent Device > WCCP v2 Service > 'Add Service...' button
  - Add WCCP v2 Service: Service Profile Name = HTTP; Service: Dynamic service ID = 10, Port numbers = 80, Redirect based on destination port = On, Load balance based on server address = On; Routed IP Addresses = 10.1.1.1 > 'Submit' button
  - Add WCCP v2 Service: Service Profile Name = HTTPS; Service: Dynamic service ID = 20, Port numbers = 443, Redirect based on destination port = On, Load balance based on server address = On; Routed IP Addresses = 10.1.1.1 > 'Submit' button
  - Transparent Redirection: Transparenet Redirection Device > Type = WCCP v2 Router; WCCP v2 Serices > Service Profile Name = HTT & HTTPS, Service ID = 10 & 20, Router IP Address = 10.1.1.1 & 10.1.1.1, Port = 80 & 443
