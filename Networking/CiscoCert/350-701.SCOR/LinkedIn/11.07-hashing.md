# Hashing

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Hashing
  - generating an output value from a known input value using a mathematical function
  - unchanging input value producing a predictable, repeatable output value
  - strong algorithms not easily reversed
  - demo: input value = 4,986
    - hash algorithm: input value * 6,563
    - hash value: 4986 * 6563 = 32,723,118
    - difficult to determine which two values were multiplied together to get the has value 32,723,118
  - in general, the larger the hash output value is, the more secure the hash function considers to be
  - larger output value resulting from a more complex and secure cryptographic algorithm


- **Message Digest 5** (MD5)
  - considered a legacy algorithm
  - not preferable for modern encryption
  - common for file verification
  - producing a 128-bit hash value output


- **Secure Hash Algorithm 1** (SHA-1)
  - considered a legacy algorithm
  - newer iteration preferred when possible
  - creating a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value output


- **Secure Hash Algorithm 2** (SHA-2)
  - designed by the NSA
  - significant improvements over SHA-1
  - 224-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit, or 512-bit
  - SHA-256 or higher preferred


- **Keyed-Hashed Message Authentication Code** (HMAC)
  - secure file transfer, e.g. SFTP and HTTPS
  - adding a shared secret key to the input value
  - cryptographic hash function computed after secret key is added
  - demo:
    - input value = 4,986
    - secrete key: 17,692
    - hash algorithm: (input value + secret key) * 6563
    - hash value: (4,968 + 17,692) * 6,563


- Cisco usage of hashing
  - IKE and IPsec protocols: verifying packet integrity and authenticity
  - routing protocol update: using HMAC to add on authentication info
  - IOS image integrity: using MD5 & SHA-512 to verify file integrity
    - Verifying image downloaded in [Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home)
    - MD5 & SHA512 checksum available
