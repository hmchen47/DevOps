# DNS tunneling

Trainer: Charles Judd



- Data exfiltration
  - occuring when malware and/or a malicious actor carries out an unauthorized data transfer from a computer
  - a.k.a. data extrusion, data exportation, or data
  - the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or other device
  - a form of security breach that occurs when an individual's or company's data is copied
  - open methods
    - HTTP/HTTPS downloads & uploads
    - FTP
    - Email
    - Instant messaging
    - P2P file sharing
  - concealed methods
    - SSH
    - VPN
    - protocol tunning
    - cloud storage uploads
    - steganography
    - timing channel


- DNS Tunneling overview
  - one of data exfiltration techniques
  - encoding data of other programs or protocols in DNS queries
  - data exfiltration tactic DNS protocol
  - sending non-DNS traffic over port 53
  - used to move protocol traffic over DNS, e.g. sending command and control callbacks

    - 1\. The attacker acquires a domain, for example, evilsite.com.
    - 2\. The attacker configures the domain’s name servers to his own DNS server.
    - 3\. The attacker delegates a subdomain, such as “tun.evilsite.com” and configures his machine as the subdomain’s authoritative DNS server.
    - 4\. Any DNS request made by the victim to “{data}.tun.evilsite.com” will end up reaching the attacker’s machine.
    - 5\. The attacker’s machine encodes a response that will get routed back to the victim’s machine.
    - 6\. A **bidirectional** data transfer channel is achieved using a DNS tunneling tool. -->


- DNS tunneling software
  - open-source DNS tunneling utilities making this relative easy to perform
  - utility incorporated into an authoritative DNS name server (NS)


- DNS tunneling workflow
  - malicious doamin registered and malicious DNS used
  - targeted system compromised w/ malware
  - malware sending DNS queries resolved to malicious domain
  - DNS request routed to the malicious server, where the tunneling software is installed
  - connection used to exfiltrate data from target network
  - exfiltration data commonly encoded as a series of 32 charactersets can broken into strings
  - strings included in the domain name lookup
  - thousands of similar requests able to export the encoded data to the malicious server

- DNS tunneling dectetion
  - tunneling utility analayzing and rebuilding the exfiltrated data being received
  - large amounts of valid DNS data on a typical network able to make discovery a challenge
  - often NGFWs and IPS unable to detect DNS tunneling
  - solution: Cisco Umbrella
    - resolving billions of DNS request per day
    - intelligence used to identify emerging DNS threats, including DNS tunneling
    - able to detect encoded DNS data
    - monitoring request volumes for any unusual DNS request spikes to a particular domain
