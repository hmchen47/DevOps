  - confidentiality: implementing measures that are designed to stop unauthorized individuals accessing sensitive data, whilst ensuring authorized individuals can still access it
  - integrity: maintaining the accuracy, consistency and trustworthiness of data
  - availability: authorized individuals are able to access their data whenever they want
  

- Confidentiality
  - only authorized individual able to view data
  - consideration on both data at rest and data in motion
  - encryption important for both data states


- Symmetric encryption
  - simplest form of encryption
  - involving only one secret key for encryption/decryption
  - more lightweight due to smaller key lengths
  - secret key security as the weak point


- Common symmetric encryption
  - DES: 45-bit hash value output
  - 3DES:
    - 112-bit and 168-bit hash value outputs
    - applying DES 3 times w/ different secrete keys
  - AES:
    - 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit hash value output
    - more secure and fast computation


- Asymmetric encryption
  - using a pair of keys to encrypt/decrypt
  - more complex and secure than symmetric encryption
  - more resource-intensive due to complex algorithms
  - public and private keys
    - publick key:
      - available to any party who encrypting data to exchange as desired
      - decrypting encrypted data w/ private key
      - possibly shared through Internet
    - private key:
      - only accessed by the key-pair creator
      - able to decrypt data encrypted w/ public key
      - unable to decrypted data geneted by private key


- Common asymmetric encryption
  - Diffie-Hellman: 512, 1024, 2048, 3072, and 4096-bit output
  - RSA and DSA: 512-bit to 1024-bit output
  - ECC: 160-bit hash value output


- Common asymmetric encryption
  - Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
  - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
  - Secure Shell (SSH)
  - Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
