# Email encryption

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Email encryption w/ ESA
  - appliance
    - encrypting message 
    - stored the key on local server or a hosted key service
  - recipient open encrypted messages
    - recipient reqires to authenticate their identity w/ key service
    - display the decrypted message
  - encryption profile including
    - encryption server and how to connect
    - envelope settings for encryption
    - how to handle forwarding and reply w/ encryption
    - notification settings


- Demo: enable message encryption on ESA
  - Security Service tab > Cisco IronPort Email Encryption
  - Cisco IronPort Email Encryption Setting: 'Enable...' button
  - Cisco IronPort Email Encryption Settings: areas - Email Encryption Global Settings, Email Encryption Profiles, PXE Engine Updates > Email Encryption Global Settings > 'Edit Settings....' button
  - Edit Cisco IronPort Email Encryption Global Settings > Cisco IronPort Email Encryption Setting: Maximu Message Size to Encrypt = 10M; Email address of the encryption account administrator = (optional) > 'Cancel' button
  - Cisco IronPort Email Encryption Settings > Email Encryption Profiles > 'Add Encryption Profile...' button
  - Add Encryption Envelope Profile: Profile Name = ENCRYPT; areas - Key Server Settings, Envelope Settings, Message Settings
    - Key Server Settings: Key Service Type = (*)Cisco Registered Envelope Service | Cisco IronPort Envelope Appliance (in network); Cisco Registered Envelope Service URL = 'https://res.cisco.com'; 'Advanced' link -> External URL for Payload Transport = Use the Cisco Registered Envelope Service URL w/ HTTP. (Recommended)
    - Envelop Settings: Envelope Message Security = High Security; Log Link = No link; Read Recipients = Enable Read Recipients; 'Advanced' link -> Encryption Queue Timeout = 14400 seconds; Encryption Algorithm = AES-192 | AES-256; Message Attachment Decryption = Use Decryption Applet (allow attachment open in browser environment)
    - Message Settings: End-user Controls: Enable Secure Reply All = On; Enable Secure Message Forwarding = On
    - Notification Sertings: Encrypted Message Text Notification = System generated; 'Preview Message' link > display sample email
    -'Submit' button > Cisco IronPort Email Encryption Settings: Suuccess - A Cisco Registerd Envelope Service profile "ENCRYPT" was saved.


- Demo: creating an outgoing mail filter
  - task:
    - scan outgoing mails and encrypting | not encrypting based on the conditions set
    - send the generated key for encrypting message to key server
  - Mail Policies tab > Outgoing Content Filters
  - Outgoing Content Filters > Filters: 'Add Filter' button
  - Add Filter Settings: Name = EncryptedFilter; areas - Conditions, Actions
    - Conditions > 'Add Condition...' button > many options
      - Message Body and Attachment: Contents text = On; Contents smart identifier (not enabled) = ABR Routing Number | Credit Card Number | CUSIP | Social Security Number (SSN)
      - Subject Header: Subject Header = contains 'SECURE'
    - 'Ok' button > Add Outgoing Content Filter
    - Actions > 'Add Action...' button: many options: Encrypt and Deliver Now (Final Action): Encryption Rule = Always use message encryption | Only use message encryption if TLS fails.; Encryption Profile = ENCRYPT; Subject = $Subject (a variable) > 'Ok' button
    - Add Outgoing Content Filter > Content Filter Settings: Name = EncryptionFilter; Conditions: Condition = Subject Header, Rule == "SECURE"; Action: Order = Final, Action = Encrypt abd Deliver Now (Final Action), Rule = encrypt("ENCRYPT", "$Subject", 0) > 'Submit' button
  - Outgoing Content Filters: Filter Name = EncryptionFilter


- Demo: apply the filter to ESA outgoing mail policy
  - Mail Policies tab > Email Security Manager > Outgoing Mail Policies
  - Outgoing Mail Policies > Policies: Policy Name = Default Policy, Content Filters = Disabled > 'Disable' link
  - Mail Policies > Content Filters: areas - Content Filtering for: Default Policy = (`*`)Enable Content Filters (Customize settings) | Disable Content Filter; Content Filters: Filter Name = EncryptionFilter, Enable =  > 'Submit' button
