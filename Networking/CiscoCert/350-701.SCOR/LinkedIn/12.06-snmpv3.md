# SNMPv3

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
  - allowing for monitoring of managed devices
  - featrues
    - detecting issues and fault early $\gets$ alerts or notifications
    - monitoring device throughput: inbound and outbound
    - remote configuration and control
  - components
    - SNMP manager
    - SNMP agent


- SNMP manager
  - polling devices to obtain info and alerts
  - typically a central software application
  - option for email/SMS alerts to administrators
  - polling over UDP port 161 by default


- SNMP agent
  - process running on a monitored device
  - info sent as a response to polling
  - able to send unsolicited message (traps) in case of emergency
  - info sent over UDP port 162 by default


- Management Information Base (MIB)
  - hierarchical database structure
  - containing object identifier (OID)
    - each OID representing a variable able to be read or set via SNMP
    - e.g. an OID in the MIB relayted a number of frames transited a particular interface
  - OIDs help identify relevant SNMP info


- Types of SNMP manager polling
  - get-request: requesting a specific IOD
  - get-next-request: requesting subsequent info after the initial request
  - get-bulk-request: requesting entire from MIB
  - set-request: used for remote configuration


- Type of SNMP agent responses
  - get-response: responses to SNMP manager pools
  - trap: data sent w/o receipt requirement
  - inform-request: acknowledgement of data receipt required from the SNMP manager by echoing the request


- SNMP version 3
  - most current version
  - addition of unique EngineID for SNMP devices
  - adding authentication based on MD5 or SHA
  - adding encryption through DES, 3DES, or AES


- SNMPv3 security levels
  - `noAuthNoPriv`: no security features of v3, same as the previous versions (`noauth`)
  - `authNoPriv`: authentication but no encryption (`auth`)
  - `authPriv`: authentication and encryption (`priv`)


- Demo: config SNMPv3
  - topology: SNMP Manager (IP = 50.1.1.5) <-> R1 as SNMP agents (IP = 10.1.1.5, 20.1.1.5)
  - defining SNMP server group:
    - creating security policies to apply to various users
    - any user assigned to a particular server group by attach the security policy
  - display R1 ACL:

    ```bash
    R1# sh ip access-list
    Standard IP access list 1
      10 permit 10.1.1.5
      20 permit 20.1.1.5
    ```

  - dispaly MIB of SNMP manager: `R1# sh snmp mib` $\to$ a long list, e.g. `ifInErrors` for intf input errors
  - config SNMP view for user: `R1(config)# snmp-server view helpdesk ifInErrors include`
    - specify what to collect
    - no `view <WORD>` in `snmp-server` cmd $\to$ all users able to see
  - config SNMP group: `R1(config)# snmp-server group admin v3 priv read helpdesk access 1`
    - `priv`: `authPriv` security level
    - `read`: specifying a read view for the group
    - `access`: specifying an access-list associated to the group
  - config user for SNMP manager to communicate w/: `R1(config)# snmp-server user charles admin v3 auth sha cisco priv aes 256 security access 1`
    - `auth`: authentication parameters for the user
    - `priv`: encryption parameters for the user
    - `access`: specifying an access-list associated w/ this group
    - `256` using 256 bit AES algorithm for encryption
    - `cisco`: authentication password for user
    - `security`: privacy password doe user
  - config to identify the SNMP manager by IP addr: `R1(config)# snmp-server host 50.1.1.5 informs version 3 priv charles`
    - `infoms`: send Inform messages to this host, both inform & traps
    - `traps`: send Trap messages to this host, older option
    - options able to be specified what traps to observe; none $\to$ all the traps
  - verify SNMP settings

    ```bash
    R1# sh snmp eng
    Local SNMP engineId: 8000000903005000000010000
    Remote Engine ID          IP-Addr     Port

    R1# sh snmp user
    User name: charles
    Engine ID: 8000000903005000000010000
    storage-type: nonvolatile     active access-list: 1
    Authentication Protocol: SHA
    Privacy Protocol: AES256
    Group-name: admin

    R1# sh snmp group
    ...
    groupname: admin                      security model: v3 priv
    contextname: <no context specified>   storage-type: nonvolatile
    readview: helpdesk                    writeview: <no writeview specified>
    notifyview: *tv.FFFFFFF.FFFFFFFF.FFFFFFFFF.F
    row status: active      access-list: 1
    ```
