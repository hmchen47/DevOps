# Dynamic file analysis

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Dynamic file analysis in AMP
  - file presented on any endpoint under control of AMP
  - continuously watching the file
  - recording the behavior and activity associated to the file
  - any changes of file regardless good or bad
  - AMP alerts and remediate the threat


- Demo: config AMP file analysis
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Analysis</span> tab > File Analysis > tabs - Your Files, Global Files
  - Your Files tab: history of analyzed files, including automatic analysis and submitted files
    - expand an entry w/ submitted file (red circle w/ dots) to review the details
    - expand to view entry details: Fingerprint (SHA-256), File name = 'abc', <span style="color: cyan;">Threat Score = 95</span>
    - 'Report' button > File Analysis for abc: sections - Analysis Report, Behavioral Indicators, HTTP Traffic, DNS Traffic, TCP/IP Streams, Processes, Artifacts
    - Behavioral Indicators: entry list > '+' icon on select entry to view details
  - Global Files tab: list of entries including public file submitted by others and private files submitted within organization > 'Search' file, 'Submit File' button, '-' and '+' icons
    - 'Report' button on selected entry > same Analysis Report format as Your Files tab


- Demo: file trajectory
  - Analysis tab > File Analysis > Your Files > entry w/ red icon > pop out menu > File Trajectory
  - File Trajectory:
    - purpose: determine the scope of the issue and pinpoint the origin endpoint
    - expanded view of the file across the environment
    - no history
    - showing the first end point of an offending file or threat and every other end point that came in contact
