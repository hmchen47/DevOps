# Public, private, hybrid, and community clouds

Trainer: Charles Judd


- NIST SP 500-322
  - outlining cloud service modes
  - describing deployment strategies

- Factors for cloud popularity
  - distributed storage for data protection
  - easily scaled out
  - automated mgmt capabilities
  - accessing from any location
  - etc.


- Essential characteristics of NIST doc
  - on-demand self-service
  - broad network access
  - resource pooling
  - rapid elasticity
  - measured service


- On-demand self-service
  - requested resource automatically processed
  - no human intervention need
  - e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - faster and more flexible than traditional deployment


- Broad network access
  - cloud resources available on a wide range of devices
  - such as PCs, Macs, tablets, smartphones, etc.


- Resource pooling
  - provider compute resource pooled together
  - resources: storage, processor, memory, and infastructure
  - offering cost saving vs. having dedicated per-customer hardware deployments


- Rapid elasticity
  - provisioning and tearing down resources quickly
  - ability to commision or decommision services as needed


- Measured service
  - cloud provider monitoring offered services
  - measuring usage-based plans
  - providing service performance assurance


- Cloud deployment models
  - private cloud
  - public cloud
  - community cloud
  - hybrid cloud


- Private cloud
  - resource used exclusively by one client
  - onsite datacenter or 3rd-party hosting
  - more privacy and security control
    - popular compliance models, such as SOX, PCI, and HIPAA
  - more expensive to deploy and maintain
  - common in sectors where security and privacy is valued, e.g. financial institutions


- Public cloud
  - provisoned for open use
  - resources owned by 3rd-party and shared over the Internet
  - examples: AWS, Azure, Dropbox, etc.
  - cost effective solution for users
  - security and privacy responsibility largely on CSP
  - compliance regulation issues, e.g. HIPAA w/ PCI DSS


- Community cloud
  - private cloud model variation
  - cloud providers catering to specific sectors
  - no concrete standards outlined for this model


- Hybrid cloud
  - combining two or more cloud models
  - able to combine benefits offered by different models
  - initial deployment costs higher than public model
  - implemention possible complex
