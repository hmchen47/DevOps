Trainer: Charles Judd


- Destination list
  - allowing to customize block policy in flexible way
  - able to block or allow any domain specifically
  - applying the list to policies
  - supporting wildcard usage
  - any allow destination list taking precedence over block destination list
  - allow list entry taking precedence over security-related blocks


- Demo: destination list
  - Policies > Policy Components > Destination Lists
  - Destination Lists: list of configured on this appliance > 'Bandwidth Hogs' & 'Marketing Allow List' links
  - Destination Lists: List Name = Bandwidth Hogs; Destination on this list will be BLOCKED > 'ADD' button to add new entry

  - NB: preventing from adding 'www.' prior to the domain name
