# NetFlow

Trainer: Charles Judd


- NetFlow overview
  - Cisco propriety
  - collecting IP traffic info
  - identifying 
    - network bottleneck areas
    - effects of policy changes and new applications
    - unauthorized / problematic traffic, such as media streaming, WAN traffic
    - security vulnerabilities and anomalies
  - capturing traffic fingerprint on ingress and/or egress
    - traffic w/ common traffic attributes grouped int a flow
    - placing Netflow cache into database


- IP flow
  - unidirectional traffic
  - packet 'fingerprint' collected by Netflow
  - similar packets grouped together into a flow record


- Attributes of Netflow cache
  - IP source and destination address
  - source and destination port
  - Layer 3 protocol type
  - router or switch interface
  - Type of Service (ToS)


- Records in Netflow cache
  - traffic attributes condensed and placed into database on the router
  - statistics of packets: number of packets, total number of bytes


- Accessing Netflow cache
  - CLI w/ show command
    - immediate info for troubleshooting
    - limited info not for long-term observation
  - Netflow collector: primary way to view info


- Netflow collector:
  - receive, intercept, and store flow records
  - data analaysis and correlation features


- Device and Netflow collector
  - exportor bundling 30-50 similar flows
  - flow data transported ove UDP to collector
  - providing real-time and historical data


- Variation and versions of Netflow
  - version 5
    - most popular version due to wide compatibility
    - using a fixed data format
  - version 9
    - most recent version w/ added security and analysis
    - using a dynamic data format w/ templates
  - Flexible Netflow
    - Cisco enhancement for more focused collection
    - using multiple flow monitors on the same traffic
      - flow monitor: a module actually examines the traffic and what to collect
      - exportter: used to export the collected data to Netflow collector
      - example: a security team to monitor anomalies and an infrastructure team to observe bandwidth utilization
    - multiple flow policies sseparating data output
