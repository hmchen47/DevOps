# ICMP

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) overview
  - common tool used for diagnosing network communication issues
  - commonly used to test reachability of a remote device
  - used in DDoS attacks, e.g. ping flood
  - every IP network device able to process ICMP messages
  - variable-sized data section


- ICMP tunneling
  - ping command sending ICMP _echo-request_
  - containing arbitrary data that is echoed back
  - attacker able to hid data inside ICMP packets, a technique called ICMP tunneling
  - ICMP trunneling able to establish communication btw an endpoint and an attacker


- ICMP tunneling detection challenges
  - ICMP often allowed through a firewall
  - not using source and destination ports $\to$ unable to use port control
  - all IP devices able to process ICMP


- ICMP exfiltration
  - blocking ICMP entirely not 100% effective
  - next-generation monitoring able to ad in detection
  - blocking ping traffic from unauthorized IP adddresses and untrusted networks
  - whitelist inly approved network monitoring components
  - solution: IPS/ITSCisco Firepower solution
    - monitoring ICMP activity w/ intrusion prevention system
    - signature checking against ICMP traffic
    - searching anything within ICMP payload
    - set ICMP rate limit
