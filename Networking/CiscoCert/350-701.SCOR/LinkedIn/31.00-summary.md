## Multifactor authentication (MFA)


- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) overview
  - two or more pieces of identity verification
  - control access to web apps, VPN usage, data, and more
  - requiring additional identity proof in conjunction w/ traditional login credential requirements


- Benefits of MFA
  - protection against brute force password attacks
  - protection against exposed or stolen credentials
  - access unable to be easily gained even if the username and password values are known


- Methods of MFA
  - one-time passwords (OPTs) - time-based
  - SMS verification codes
  - email verification codes


- Activating MFA feature
  - enable MFA inside the application security settings
  - setup a second verification method
  - OPT method reqires association w/ OPT application


- Example: Google account
  - enable MFA to generate a QR code
  - Google authenticator app as OPT app and choose to add an account
  - then scan the provided QR code
  - entering a 6-digit code into the account
  - code expired every 30 seconds
  - login Google account by using username and password and entering the 6-digit code


- 3 potential types as additional identity information
  - knowledge: something you know, e.g., password or pin
  - possession: something you have, e.g., badge or smartphone
  - inheritance: something you are, e.g., biometric data


- Use of MFA
  - knowledge is typically the primary identificationtype
  - MFA adds additional identification from any of the three categories (knowledge, possession, or inheritance)


- MFA vs 2FA
  - two-factor authentication (2FA): using exactly two types of identity authentication
  - multifactor authentication (MFA): able to require more than two types of identity authentication


- Reasons to use MFA
  - passowrds alone is no longer enough
  - exposed, stolen, or leaked credentials are a huge threat to our security



## Endpoint posture assessment


- End posture assessment overview
  - posture: the compliance status of a device on the network
  - probably the most important concept for end points
  - endpoints as a very large attack surface on the network
  - each organization establishing its own criteria to determine what proper posture for endpoints
  - common posture concerns
    - operating systems patch and status
    - local disk encryption
    - up-to-date antimalware protection suite in place
    - awareness of external devices, e.g., USB attached storage devices


- Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE)
  - allowing to set up endpoint posture policies for endpoint devices
  - policies varying based on user's roles, types of devices, locations, etc.
  - endpoint associated w/ a particular posture policy unable to access network until requirements of the policy meet


- Demo: enable posture service in ISE
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Administration</span> tab > System > Deployment
  - Deployment: folders - Deployment, PAN Failover
  - Deployment > Deployment Nodes: entry fields - Hostname, Personas, Role(s), Services > entry - Hostname = ise > 'ise' link
  - Edit Node: subtabs - General Settings, Profiling Configuration
    - General Settings: Hostname = ise, FQDN = ise.dcloud.cisco.com, IP address = 198.18.133.27, Node Type = Identity Service Engine (ISE); Role STANDALONE:  <span style="color: cyan;">Policy Service = On</span>, Enable Session Services = On, Enable Profiling Service = On, Enable Passive Identity Service = On

## Endpoint patching


- Endpoint patching benefits
  - security from known vulnerabilities
  - known vulnerabilities offer a well documented and legitimate attack vector
  - ensure endpoints fall under compliance regulations


- Best practices of endpoint patching
  - accurate inventory critical for ensuring protection
  - using automated patch management tools
  - using endpoint status reporting
  - testing patches in a sandbox environmen before deployment
  - checking for unexpected or adverse consequence
  - test rollback abilities of patches
  - subscribing to vendor security feeds
  - consider using consolidated feeds, such as the National Vulnerability Database from NIST
  - pare down announcements and alerts to only those needed
  - consolidating software when possible
  - multiple versions of a software meaning more vulnerabilities
  - assigning assets to a risk category
  - understanding which systems are most critical
  - more exposed assets should get priority patching
