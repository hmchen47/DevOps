# Multifactor authentication (MFA)

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) overview
  - two or more pieces of identity verification
  - control access to web apps, VPN usage, data, and more
  - requiring additional identity proof in conjunction w/ traditional login credential requirements


- Benefits of MFA
  - protection against brute force password attacks
  - protection against exposed or stolen credentials
  - access unable to be easily gained even if the username and password values are known


- Methods of MFA
  - one-time passwords (OPTs) - time-based
  - SMS verification codes
  - email verification codes


- Activating MFA feature
  - enable MFA inside the application security settings
  - setup a second verification method
  - OPT method reqires association w/ OPT application


- Example: Google account
  - enable MFA to generate a QR code
  - Google authenticator app as OPT app and choose to add an account
  - then scan the provided QR code
  - entering a 6-digit code into the account
  - code expired every 30 seconds
  - login Google account by using username and password and entering the 6-digit code


- 3 potential types as additional identity information
  - knowledge: something you know, e.g., password or pin
  - possession: something you have, e.g., badge or smartphone
  - inheritance: something you are, e.g., biometric data


- Use of MFA
  - knowledge is typically the primary identificationtype
  - MFA adds additional identification from any of the three categories (knowledge, possession, or inheritance)


- MFA vs 2FA
  - two-factor authentication (2FA): using exactly two types of identity authentication
  - multifactor authentication (MFA): able to require more than two types of identity authentication


- Reasons to use MFA
  - passowrds alone is no longer enough
  - exposed, stolen, or leaked credentials are a huge threat to our security
