# Pre-shared key authentication

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Pre-shared key (PSK) theory
  - mostly used for wireless connection via WiFi protected access, known as WPA
  - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
    - a suite of wireless protocols
    - replacing duplicated WEP (Wire Equivalent Privacy)
    - 3 protocols: WPA, WPA2, and WPA3
    - commonly seen in home wireless deployments
    - all WPA versions supporting personal mode (PSK) and enterprise mode (802.1x)
  - personal mode:
    - a PSK string configured on controller, APs, and clients
    - easier to configure
    - no special client software required
    - some legacy devices not supporting 802.1x, special supplicant software required in client
  - demo: guest user (computer) ->wireless-> access point (AP) ->wireline-> wireless LAN controller (WLC)
    - a key string configured on WLC for a specific wireless network
    - the key string configured or shared on all clients and/or APs connected to the network
    - the key string never passed over the air
    - 4-way handshaking process to build encryption key which cab be openly exchanged w/o intercepted
  - **Temporary Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)**
    - used by original WPA standard
    - combining key string and SSID to generate unique encryption keys
  - **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**
    - used by WPA2 and WPA3 as a more advanced encryption algorithm than TKIP
    - protecting against password attacks

- Pres-shared key (PSK)
  - benefits
    - less complex than 802.1x deployments (RADIUS server required)
    - legacy client support
  - limitations
    - less secure
    - more administration burden
    - requiring complex key creation


- Common configuration for PSK
  - device: Cisco WLC
  - login the configuration page
  - WLANs tab: shown all configured networks
  - recommendation: separated keys for corrprate and guess networks
  - corproate network > editing page
  - security tab: 
    - Layer 2 Security = WPA + WPA2
    - WPA + WPA2 Parameters: WPA Policy = False (not recommended); WPA2 Encryption = AES
    - Authentication Key Management: PSK = True; PSK Format = ASCII & entering the key string
    - click on Apply button
