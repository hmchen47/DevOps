- Traditional IPS issues
  - requiring more management than NGIPS
  - creating large amount of data that can be difficult to correlate
  - no perspective into the existence of vulnerabilities, simply monitor for attempts to exploit a vulnerability


- Nex Generation IPS (NGIPS)
  - layer 7 visibility
  - automated tuning and recommendations
  - more thorough perspective into network traffic, e.g. file passing btw two hosts
  - better user identify management


- Cisco FirePOWER Management Center (FMC)
  - central management of multiple solutions
    - application control
    - intrustion prevention
    - URL filtering
    - malware protection
  - complete visibility into the nextwork
    - network
    - applications
    - hots, mobile devices
    - files
