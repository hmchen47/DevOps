# Application and data security

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Security testing
  - static application security testing (SAST)
  - dynamic application security testing (DAST)


- Static application security testing
  - 'white box' testing method
  - test from inside-out, w/ access to the underlying framework, design, and implementation
  - typical developer approach to testing
  - using analysis against source code to test for vulnerabilities w/o executing the application
  - generally help to find vulnerabilities earlier
  - unable to discover runtime and environment-relate dissues


- Dynamic application security testing
  - 'black box' testing method
  - test from the outside-in, w/ no knowledge of the technology or underlying framework
  - typical pentration tester approach
  - testing executed against the application itself
  - finding vulnerabilities after development cycle completed
  - issues corrected w/ vulnerability patches


- SAST and DAST
  - not an either/or situation
  - comprehensive security: both types of testing used
  - example tools:
    - 'Find Security Bugs': find bugs in applications w/ Java
    - 'snoarqube': find vulnerabilities in coding for many different languages


- Fuzzing testing (Fuzzing)
  - sending random data into an application or OS
  - able to detect potential program failures, buffer overflows, or other errors
  - example tool: munity fuzzer
