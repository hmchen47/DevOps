- Categories of threats
  - on-premise threats
  - cloud-based threats

- Termonologies for on-premise threats
  - **on-premise network:** network environment physically present on the premise of the business
  - **malware:**
    - catch-all term for malicious software
    - not an interchangeable term for "virus"
    - computer virus as a category of malware
    - categories: spyware, adware, ransomeware, etc.
  - **virus:**
    - human intervention required for spreading
    - contain search and infection routines
      - search routine: locating new things to infect
      - infection routing: multiplying  the virus
    - contain malicious payloads
    - actions probably including file alteration or deletion
    - advanced versions containing anti-detection routines to 
      - suppress warning messages
      - modify the underlying code for stealth
  - **trojan**
    - threats disguided as legitimate terms
    - execution to download or install harmful malware
    - not self-duplicated as a virus does
    - goal: providing system access for broader attack
    - often installing malware, obtaining remote access, disabling security systems, steal sensitive information, etc.
  - **DoS and DDoS Attacks**
    - designed to disrupt or disable a network
    - example: ICMP Ping Flood attack
    - DoS: single attacking system
    - DDoS: Botnet attacks (most common)
  - **Phishing**
    - used to steal sensitive user data
    - most commonly achieved through email
    - email links or attachments redirect to malicious websites under the attacker's control
  - **Rootkit**
    - designed to obtain privilege system access
    - goal: remain quietly in the background
    - especially hard to remove w/o drastic actions
    - common delivery methods including trojans and phishing campaigns
  - **Main-in-the-Middle Attacks**
    - attackers positioned logically btw a user and destination resource for data interception
    - example: rouge access points, DNS spoofing, etc.
    - main characteristic: communication interception
  - **SQL Injection Attacks**
    - SQL: standard language used for databases
    - target database resources such as we applications
    - partial SQL commands able to return unexpected actions or access to a database
  - **In-Band SQL Injection Attacks**: data directly visible in the web app or web page
  - **Out-of-Band SQL Injection Attacks**: data transmitted over a different channel
  - **Blind SQL Injection Attacks**: information learned through trial and error interaction
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    - malicious scripts injected into trusted websites
    - harmful script executed to perform actions
  - **Reflected XSS Attack**
    - delivered through phishing or search engines
    - malicious links redirect to a vulnerable server which injects harmful code into browser
  - **Persistent (Stored) XSS Attack**
    - malicious code permanently stored in database
    - malicious link not required for delivery
