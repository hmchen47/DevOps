# Cloud application and workload security

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Cloud workload
  - the amount of activity running on a cloud instance
  - cloud workload continues to increase w/ popularity
    - low cost and easy of use w/ cloud solutions
    - security challenges as oppose to in-house architecture


- Cisco solutions
  - Cisco AppDynamics (AppD)
  - Cisco Workload Optimization Manager (CWOM)


- Cisco AppDynamics
  - automatic discovery and dynamic mapping of every application in a topology
  - compatible w/ many platform, including AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Citrix, and more
    - full stack visibility
    - visibility into physical, virtual, cloud, and container environments


- Cisco Workload Optimization Manager (CWOM)
  - deployed as a virtual machine on local network
  - agent-less technology monitoring managed hosts
  - visually mapping applications and infrastructure, including local, remote, private and public cloud assets


- AppD + CWOM
  - monitoring application performance and cloud workload
  - predictive modeling to forecast future needs
  - tracking CPU, memory, latency, and other metrics
  - automation features for scaling


- Cisco Secure Workload (formally Tetration)
  - software agents deployed on major OS distributions
  - agents acting as sensors to collect data for policy enforcement
  - able to collect info from Cisco infrastructure
  - gathered data used for analytics
    - monitoring and alerting by capturing real time forensic info
  - micro-segmentation for cloud environment
  - segmentation policies for each cloud application
  - reduced overall attack surface
  - improving breach containment capabilities
