# Profiling

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Profiling w/ ISE overview
  - providing secure network access
  - able to identify each device connected to network
  - simply gathering the data about a specific end point to determin info of the device
  - many use cases
    - different policies based on device types
    - not authenticating certain devices, such as printers


- ISE network probe
  - gathering info w/ network probes
  - probes analyzing the behavior of network devices and determining the type of device in use
  - example: card type or Mac address to determine the device category
  - profiling not one-time action but a continuous process
  - able to discovery spoofing devices


- Demo: check types of endpoints
  - Work Centers: sections - Network Access, Guest Access, TrustSec, BYOD, Profiler, Posture, Device Adminstration, PassiveID
  - Work Centers tab > Profiler > <span style="color: cyan;">Endpoint Classification</span>: areas - ENDPOINTS, ENDPOINT CATEGORIES, NETWORK DEVICES, entries


- Demo: enable profiling
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Administration</span> tab: sections - System, Identity Management, Network Resources, Device Portal Management, pxGrid Services, Feed Service, Threat Centric NAC
  - Administration tab > System > Deployment: folders - Deployment, PAN Fallover
  - Deployment Nodes: entry fields - Hostname, Personas, Role(s), Services, Mode Service > entry - Hostname = ise24 > 'ise24' link
  - Edit Node: tabs - General Settings, Profiling Configuration
  - General Settings: Policy Service = On, <span style="color: cyan;">Enabling Profiling Service = On</span>


- Demo: config profiling
  - choosing method for profiling
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Administration</span> tab > System > Deployment > Edit Node
  - Profiling Configuration: options - NETFLOW, DHCP, DHCPSPAN, HTTP, RADIUS, Network Scan (NMAP), DNS, SNMPQUERY, SNMPTRAP, Active Directory, etc


- Demo: viewing Cisco predefined profile or attribute
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Policy</span> tab > Policy Elements > <span style="color: cyan;">Dictionaries</span>: folders - System, User
  - list of predefined or customer created profile attributes


- Demo: performing endpoint scan 
  - <span style="color: cyan;">Word Centers</span> tab > Profiler > <span style="color: cyan;">Manual Scans</span>: subtabs - Manual NMAP Scan, Manual NAMP Scan Results
  - Run Manual NAMP Scan: Node, Manual Scan Subnet, Scan Options = Specify scan options | Select an existing NAMP scan action
  - Scan Options: OS, SNMP Port, Common ports, Run SMB Discovery script, Skip NAMP Host Discovery, Include service version information
  - scanning subnet probably a length process
  - assigning devices into their own identity groups according to gathered info 


- Demo: creating endpoint profiling policies
  - Policy tab > <span style="color: cyan;">Profiling</span>: dropdown box - Show; entry fields - Profiling Policy Name, Policy Enabled, System Type, Description
  - Show (filter) w/ attributes: Profiling Policy Name, Policy Enabled, System Type, Description
  - entry - Profile Policy: Name = Apple-Watch, Policy Enabled = On, Minimum Certainty Factor = 20, Exception Action = NONE, Network Scan (NMAP) Action = NONE, Parent Policy = , Associated CoA Type = Global Settings, Rules
  - Rules:
    - If Condition 'Apple-Watch-Rules2-Check1' Then 'Certainty Factor Increases' '20'
    - If Condition 'Apple-Watch-Rules1-Check1' Then 'Certainty Factor Increases' '25'
  - **Certainty Factor**: adding values and comparing to 'Minimum Certainty Factor' (threshold) to determine the category


- Demo: viewing the type of endpoint profile w/ a device
  - Context Visibility tab > Endpoints
  - list of endpoints w/ attributes: MAC Address, Status, IP Address, Username, Hostname, Portal User, Locaton, Anomalous, <span style="color: cyan;">Endpoint Profile</span>, ...
  - able to search for a specific attribute w/ given words
  - click on entry link to dispaly more detailed info


- Demo: viewing profiling set
  - Policy tab > Policy Sets
  - list of policies > Policy Set?: entry - Name = Default, View = **>**, ... > '>' icon to expan the entry
  - Default Policy -> Default > entries - Authentication Policy, Authorization Policy - Local Exception, Authorization Policy - Global Exceptions, Authorization Policy
  - Authorization Policy > entries of policies
