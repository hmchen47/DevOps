# Profiling

Trainer: Charles Judd


- Profiling w/ ISE overview
  - providing secure network access
  - able to identify each device connected to network
  - simply gathering the data about a specific end point to determin info of the device
  - many use cases
    - different policies based on device types
    - not authenticating certain devices, such as printers
  - gathering info w/ network probes
  - probes analyzing the behavior of network devices and determining the type of device in use
  - example: card type or Mac address to determine the device category
  - profiling not one-time action but a continuous process
  - able to discovery spoofing devices


- Demo: types of endpoints
  - Work Centers sections: Network Access, Guest Access, TrustSec, BYOD, Profiler, Posture, Device Adminstration, PassiveID
  - Work Centers tab > Profile > Endpoint Classification: ENDPOINTS, ENDPOINT CATEGORIES, NETWORK DEVICES


- Demo: enable ptofiling
  - Administration sections: System, Identity Management, Network Resources, Device Portal Management, pxGrid Services, Feed Service, Threat Centric NAC
  - Administration tab > System > Deployment: Deployment, PAN Fallover
  - Deployment Nodes: Hostname = ise24 > 'ise24' link
  - Edit Node: General Settings, Profiling Configuration
  - General Settings: Policy Service = On, Enabling Profiling Service = On


- Demo: config profiling
  - Administration tab > System > Deployment > Edit Node
  - Profiling Configuration: options - NETFLOW, DHCP, DHCPSPAN, HTTP, RADIUS, Network Scan (NMAP), DNS, SNMPQUERY, SNMPTRAP, Active Directory, etc


- Demo: viewing Cisco predefined profile or attribute
  - Policy tab > Policy Elements > Dictionaries: folders - System, User
  - list of predefined or customer created profile attributes


- Demo: performaing endpoint scan
  - Word Centers tab > Profiler > Manual Scans: Manual NMAP Scan, Manual NAMP Scan Results
  - Run Manual NAMP Scan: Node, Manual Scan Subnet, Scan Options = Specify scan options | Select an existing NAMP scan action
  - Scan Options: OS, SNMP Port, Common ports, Run SMB Discovery script, Skip NAMPHost Discovery, Include service version information
  - scanning subnet probably a length process
  - assigning devices into their own identity groups according to gathered info 


- Demo: creating endpoint profiling policies
  - Policy tab > Profiling: add, edit, duplicate, delete, import or export, Show
  - Show (filter) w/ attributes: Profiling Policy Name, Policy Enabled, System Type, Description
  - click on entry > Profile Policy: Name = Apple-Watch, Policy Enabled = On, Minimum Certainty Factor = 20, Exception Action = NONE, Network Scan (NMAP) Action = NONE, Parent Policy = , Assocaited CoA Type = Global Settings, Rules
  - Rules: If Condition 'Apple-Watch-Rules2-Check1' Then 'Certainty Factor Increases' '20'
  - Certainty Factor: adding values and comparing to 'Minimum Certainty Factor' (threshold) to determine the category


- Demo: viewing the type of endpoint profile w/ a device
  - Context Visibility tab > Endpoints
  - list of endpoints w/ attributes
  - attributes: MAC Address, Status, IP Address, Username, Hostname, Portal User, Locaton, Anomalous, Endpoint Profile, ...
  - able to search for a specific attribute w/ given words
  - click on entry link to dispaly more detailed info


- Demo: viewing profiling set
  - Policy tab > Policy Sets
  - list of policies > Policy Set Name = Default > view = '>' > '>' icon
  - entries: Authentication Policy, Authorization Policy - Local Exception, Authorization Policy - Global Exceptions, Authorization Policy
  - Authorization Policy > entries of policies
