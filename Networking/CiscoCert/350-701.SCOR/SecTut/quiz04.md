## 16. Cisco Umbrella

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: blue;">Cisco Umbrella Quick Summary</span>

Cisco Umbrella protects users from accessing malicious domains by proactively analyzing and blocking unsafe destinations – before a connection is ever made. Thus it can protect from phishing attacks by blocking suspicious domains when users click on the given links that an attacker sent.

When Umbrella receives a DNS request, it uses intelligence to determine if the request is safe, malicious or risky — meaning the domain contains both malicious and legitimate content. Safe and malicious requests are routed as usual or blocked, respectively. Risky requests are routed to our cloud-based proxy for deeper inspection. The Umbrella proxy uses Cisco Talos web reputation and other third-party feeds to determine if a URL is malicious.

Cisco Umbrella roaming protects your employees even when they are off the VPN.
