! 1. basic system setup
no ip domain-lookup
enable secret Class
! no ip domain-lookup--> To disable the IP Domain Naming System (DNS)-based host 
!   name-to-address translation
!
! The purpose of this command is to assist the administrator resolve names into ip 
! addresses so they may telnet to remote devices. The issues are that the system does 
! not understand the difference between a valid hostname and a typo. In most cases if 
! not all the system will interpret a typo as a hostname and start to broadcast out to 
! DNS on the address of 255.255.255.255.  
!
! The broadcast itself is a minor nuisance on the network but the major issue that in a 
! majority of times the console from which they are configuring the system will lock up 
! whilst it is broadcasting out for the non-existent IP address for the typo.
!
! To prevent the console from timing out every time a typo is issued it important to 
! turn the "ip domain-lookup" off. At this point it is important to mention that only 
! typos executed at the "user mode" and "privileged exec mode" will cause a time-out to 
! occur, if a typo is issued under any off the other commands prompts the Cisco device 
! will simply return an error message and return the command prompt without any console 
! timeout.
! 
! enable secret class --> Sets the encrypted version of the routers password to “class”
!
! The enable password uses type 5 endryption (if you use service-password encryption) 
! and is easy to crack VERY easy. It was replaced with the enable secret command which 
! uses type 7 encryption and is hard to crack.



! 2. enable console's basic settings
line con 0
logg sync
no exec-t
privilege level 15
! These lines enable telent on console 0 and some basic setting.
! line con 0 --> enter "line console 0" interface
! logg sync --> logging synchronous, copies whatever text is on the line again after the
!               debug is printed.
! no exec-t --> no exec-timeout, To set the interval that the EXEC command interpreter 
!               waits until user input is detected


! 3. enable telnet and its basic settings
line vty 0 15
logg sync
no exec -t
login
privilege level 15
password cisco
exit
! line vty 0 4 --> enter a group of vty lines 0~4
! login local --> telling the device to use the locally configured accounts in the 
!                 username database.  Enable local password checking at login ime.  
!                 Authentication is based on the specified username.  
! login --> enable password checking at terminal session login. Authetication is based
!           on the password/secret setting
! privilege level 15 --> privilege EXEC mode
!   The Cisco IOS offers 16 privilege levels for access to different commands.  
!   The higher your privilege level, the more router access you have.  most users 
!   of Cisco routers are familiar with only two privilege levels:
!	User EXEC mode—privilege level 1
!	Privileged EXEC mode—privilege level 15
!   By default, typing enable takes you to level 15, privileged EXEC mode. In the Cisco 
!   IOS, this level is equivalent to having root privileges in UNIX or administrator 
!   privileges in Windows. In other words, you have full access to the router.
!   Verify: Show privilege
! password cisco --> set the password "cisco" for line vty 0 4


! 4. Assign device name  
hostname <hostname>

! hostname <hostname> --> set device's anme

! 5. Store running configuration to startup configuration 
copy runn start
!
! NB: wr = write memory (obsolate) use newer "copy ..." instead
