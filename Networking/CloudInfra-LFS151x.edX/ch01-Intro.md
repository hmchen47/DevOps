Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies

# Chapter 1. Welcome and Introduction

## Introduction to Cloud Computing and Technologies
Historically, the word __Cloud__ was used as a metaphor for Internet. Later on, it was used to depict the Internet in computer network diagrams. To find out more about the origin of the Cloud, you can take a look at the details provided on [Wikipedia][wiki].

__Cloud Computing__ can be referred as the allocation of resources on the Cloud. According to [NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology)][nist], the formal definition of __Cloud Computing__  is the following: 

    "__Cloud Computing__ is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

__Cloud Computing__ providers offer different kinds of services built on top of basic provisioning and releasing of resources. Most of these services fall into one of the following categories: 

+ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
+ Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
+ Software as a Service (SaaS). 

We will cover these categories and others throughout the course. Most providers use some form of web interface, on top of which we can build the desired stack. Cloud Providers use a pay-as-you-go model, in which we pay for the resources we have used in a given duration.

## Key Features of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing provides key features such as:

+ _Speed and Agility_

    The required resources are just one click away, which saves time and provides agility. We can also easily scale up or down, depending on our need.
+ _Cost_ 

    It reduces the up-front cost to setup the infrastructure and allows us to focus on applications and business. Cloud providers have features to estimate the cost, which helps us plan better.
+ _Easy access to resources_ 

    As users, we can access our infrastructure from any place and device, as long as we can connect to the provider.
+ _Maintenance_ 

    All the maintenance work for the resources is done by the provider. As end-users, we do not have to worry about this aspect.
+ _Multi-tenancy_ 

    Multiple users can use the same pool of resources.
+ _Reliability_ 

    Resources can be hosted in different Datacenter locations, to provide increased reliability.


## Cloud Deployment Models
Generally, a Cloud is deployed in the following models: 

+ __Private Cloud__

    It is designated and operated solely for one organization. It can be hosted internally or externally and managed by internal teams or a third party. We can build a Private Cloud using a software stack like [OpenStack][stack].

+ __Public Cloud__

    It is open to the public and anybody can use it after swiping the credit card. __AWS__ and __Google Compute Engine__ are examples of Public Clouds.

+ __Hybrid Cloud__

    Public and Private Clouds are bound together to offer the Hybrid Cloud. Among other things, a Hybrid Cloud can be used to:
    - Store sensitive information on a Private Cloud, while offering public services based on that information from a Public Cloud.
    - Meet the temporary resources needed from the Public Cloud. These temporary resources cannot be met from a Private Cloud.

## The Linux Foundation
__The Linux Foundation__ partners with the world's leading developers and companies to solve the hardest technology problems and accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. __The Linux Foundation__ makes it its mission to provide experience and expertise to any initiative working to solve complex problems through open source collaboration, providing the tools to scale open source projects: security best practices, governance, operations and ecosystem development, training and certification, licensing, and promotion.

__Linux__ is the world's largest and most pervasive open source software project in history. __The Linux Foundation__ is home to __Linux__ creator Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman, and provides a neutral home where Linux kernel development can be protected and accelerated for years to come. The success of __Linux__ has catalyzed growth in the open source community, demonstrating the commercial efficacy of open source and inspiring countless new projects across all industries and levels of the technology stack.

__The Linux Foundation__'s work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at every layer of the software stack. __The Linux Foundation__ is the umbrella organization for many critical open source projects that power corporations today, spanning all industry sectors:

+ __Networking__: [OpenDaylight][dayl], [OPNFV][opnfv]
+ __Embedded__: [Dronecode][dron]
+ __Web tools__: [JS Foundation][jsfd], [Node.js][node]
+ __Cloud computing__: [Cloud Foundry][cfun], [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf], [Open Container Initiative][oci]
+ __Automotive__: [Automotive Grade Linux][agl]
+ __Security__: [The Core Infrastructure Initiative][cii]
+ __Blockchain__: [Hyperledger][hl]
+ And many more.
